# Orphaned Documentation Pages – July 10 2025

This table lists every Markdown file that lives in `docusaurus/docs/` **but is *not* referenced anywhere in `docusaurus/sidebars.ts`.**  
For each page you’ll see a quick title/summary and a suggested spot in the left-hand navigation.  The goal is to make it easy for maintainers to decide where (or whether) each article should be re-inserted.

### Notes & Methodology

- The list was generated by diffing **all** `.md` files in `docusaurus/docs/` against the doc-IDs hard-coded in `docusaurus/sidebars.ts` (case-sensitive, extension-stripped).  
- “Stub” pages (those marked `draft: true` and containing primarily *TODO* copy) are still listed so that maintainers can decide whether to surface them or leave them hidden.  
- Where appropriate, pages were grouped under existing nav categories (e.g., *Administration › Settings*).  When no suitable category exists, a **new collapsed top-level section** is suggested.  
- For multi-page feature areas (e.g., *App Settings* inside Administration), child documents are proposed as nested items to keep the sidebar tidy.
