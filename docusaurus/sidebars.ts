/**
* Sidebar configuration
*
* We want “Getting Started with Business App” to be the very first
* top-level navigation item. Docusaurus allows mixing arbitrary links
* with autogenerated content, so we:
*
*   1. Insert a plain `link` item that points to the existing “Overview”
*      document (located at `docs/overview/index.md`).
*   2. Follow it with the fully autogenerated sidebar so that the rest of
*      the documentation structure remains unchanged.
*
* Using a `link` item (instead of duplicating the doc via `doc`/`ref`) avoids
* duplicate-ID errors because the same document will still appear inside the
* autogenerated “Business App” category further down the tree.
