# Google Cloud Armor

When a website is compromised, it is no longer serving the intended information to visitors at best, and sending stolen information about users at worst. Because of this, it is very important to do what we can to ensure that the websites that we host are safe and secure.

## What is it?
Google Cloud Armor is now available for websites to route their traffic through. Google Cloud Armor is a firewall that sits in front of our websites that helps detect and block malicious traffic. Some of the attacks that will be blocked include:

*   Direct Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks
*   SQL Injections
*   Brute force attacks on login forms ran by bots

**Instructions**:

1.  Log into the website that you have purchased your domain from
2.  For each domain purchased, update the A record to the below IP
    1.  **34.149.86.124**

Additional information about how to configure your domain can be found [here](./connect-custom-domain.md).
