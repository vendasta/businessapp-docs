Ensuring the security of your website is essential, as compromised sites can mislead users or even steal their information. Google Cloud Armor is a tool designed to protect websites by blocking malicious traffic and preventing common attacks.

### What is Google Cloud Armor?

Google Cloud Armor is a firewall that acts as a shield for websites, routing traffic through a layer of security to detect and block harmful activities. It safeguards against various attacks, including:

*   **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks**: Large-scale attacks aimed at overwhelming the website’s server.
*   **SQL Injections**: Attempts to manipulate a website’s database through insecure inputs.
*   **Brute Force Attacks**: Automated, high-frequency login attempts to gain unauthorized access.

### How to Set Up Google Cloud Armor

1.  **Log in to Your Domain Provider’s Account**
    
    *   Access the website where you purchased your domain.
2.  **Update the A Record**
    
    *   For each domain, modify the **A record** to the following IP address:
        *   **34.149.86.124**

For more guidance on domain configuration, see [Set up your domain](../domains/set-up-your-domain).

Using Google Cloud Armor can help you keep your website secure, protecting both your data and your visitors.
