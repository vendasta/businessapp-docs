If the Advanced Login feature is enabled, logging into the WordPress dashboard from Partner Center or Business App could be affected if a reCaptcha is set up on the WordPress login page.

When the toggle is turned off, a user can log in using www.domainname.com/wp-admin.

If you would still like to log in from Partner Center or Business App, simply disable the captcha feature on the login page (If using a reCaptcha plugin, simply disabling the plugin should achieve this).
