WordPress Hosting users can clear their site cache manually. This ensures updates and changes show up instantly to site visitors.

### More on caching

WordPress Hosting's built-in server-side caching is what makes your sites lightning fast. To deliver content as quickly as possible, WordPress Hosting serves up “cached” versions of pages rather than dynamically generating them each time. 

The result is that your WordPress Hosting sites load very fast. However WordPress Hosting's built-in caching refreshes every hour. This means that if content changes your users may get the old (cached) version, instead of the latest version.

To combat this, we have **added the ability to flush your site cache manually**. 

### How to manually flush site cache

To ensure website visitors always see the latest version of your files, click the **Flush Cache** button on the product **Overview page** after making changes. This will clear the cache for your site instantly.
