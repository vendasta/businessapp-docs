WordPress Hosting Pro uses caching to speed up your site. However, changes may not show immediately due to this caching.

## Temporarily Bypass Cache

To bypass the cache temporarily:

* Add `/?skip` to the end of your page URL
  * Example: `https://examplewebsite.com/?skip`

This forces your browser to pull the latest version of the page.

## Permanent Solution

For a more permanent solution, you can manually flush your site's cache in the WordPress Hosting **Pro Overview** tab.
