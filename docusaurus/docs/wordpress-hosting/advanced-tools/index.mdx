<summary>How do I use SFTP to access my site's file system?</summary>

WordPress Hosting Pro allows you to connect via **SFTP** (Secure File Transfer Protocol), which encrypts your connection for secure file access.

**Step 1: Add an SFTP key pair**

1. Go to your WordPress Hosting **Pro Dashboard** and find the **SFTP section**.
2. Click **Add Key**, name your key, and generate the key pair.
3. **Download the private key** associated with your site. This is required to authenticate your SFTP session.

**Step 2: Connect using FileZilla (or another SFTP client)**

1. Open FileZilla and go to **File > Site Manager > New Site**.
2. Configure the connection:
   * **Host**: `sftp.websitepro.hosting`
   * **Port**: `22`
   * **Protocol**: `SFTP – SSH File Transfer Protocol`
   * **Logon Type**: Key File
   * **User**: Your provided username
   * **Key file**: Browse and select your downloaded private key
3. Click **Connect**

Once connected, you'll be able to upload files, remove plugins/themes, and manage your site directly.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I log in to WordPress Hosting Pro SFTP with a username and password?</summary>

No. WordPress Hosting Pro does **not support password-based SFTP access**.

To connect over SFTP, you must:
* Generate a **key file** from the WordPress Hosting Pro dashboard
* Use an SFTP client like FileZilla with your username and key file

> For setup steps, see: How to use SFTP to access the file system in the WordPress Hosting dashboard under Advanced Tools.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I check which PHP extensions are enabled?</summary>

Yes. Follow these steps:

1. On your computer, create a file named `phpinfo.php`.
2. Add the following code:

```php
<?php
phpinfo();
?>
```

3. Upload this file to your site's `wp` directory using SFTP.
4. Visit `yourdomain.com/phpinfo.php` in a browser.
5. Look for the extensions section to confirm whether tools like `cURL` or `FTP` are enabled.
6. **Delete the file after checking.**

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I make changes to the `php.ini` file?</summary>

No. The `php.ini` file is not accessible or editable on WordPress Hosting Pro or Standard. This is part of our secure hosting environment. If you need help with a specific PHP configuration, please contact Support.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How do I increase the file upload limit in WordPress?</summary>

You can increase the upload limit using a plugin, but the maximum limit in WordPress Hosting Pro is **256 MB**.

To increase the default upload limit:

1. In WordPress, go to **Plugins > Add New**
2. Install **Big File Uploads – Increase Maximum File Upload Size**
3. Activate the plugin
4. Navigate to **Media > Big File Uploads** and set your desired limit (up to 256 MB)

> If you need to upload files larger than 256 MB, use **SFTP** to upload directly to your server.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I increase the upload limit for the All-in-One WP Migration plugin?</summary>

Yes, but it depends on the plugin version:

* Default limit: **64 MB**
* With free extension: **Up to 512 MB**
* For larger sites: **Use the All-in-One WP Migration Unlimited extension**

This extension is not installed by default. If you need help installing it, our support team can assist.

<details>
<summary>Why can't I use plugins that require the XMLRPC.php file?</summary>

The `xmlrpc.php` file enables remote access to WordPress, but it is **disabled by default** in WordPress Hosting Pro and WordPress Hosting Standard due to known security vulnerabilities.

Plugins that rely on it, such as **Jetpack** or certain **Zapier** integrations, may not function correctly.

* [Why XMLRPC is blocked (WP Engine)](https://wpengine.com/resources/xmlrpc-php/)

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I hide the Advanced Tools tab?</summary>

Admin users can remove the **Advanced Tools** tab from the WordPress Hosting dashboard.

This prevents access to:
* phpMyAdmin
* SFTP
* PHP logs
* Advanced WordPress login option

**To disable it:**

1. Go to **Product Info** in your dashboard
2. Click the **Admin Tools** tab
3. Go to **Product Settings**
4. Toggle off **Show Advanced Features**

> This change applies globally and cannot be customized per account.

Admin users will still be able to see and use all advanced tools.

<details>
<summary>Do I get access to cPanel when hosting on WordPress Hosting Pro?</summary>

No — **[cPanel](https://cpanel.net/) is not used** with WordPress Hosting Pro.

WordPress Hosting Pro is a fully managed hosting environment built on Google Cloud infrastructure. It handles traditional cPanel features internally, including:
* Domain management
* Backups and restores
* SSL provisioning

If you need direct technical access, you can use:
* **phpMyAdmin** for database management
* **SFTP** (with a key file) for accessing your file system
