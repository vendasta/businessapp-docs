Even though Google has made some efforts to be GDPR compliant with the release of Google Analytics 4 (GA4), it is generally accepted that both Universal Analytics and GA4 are not GDPR compliant with their default settings. All websites created with WordPress Hosting come with a default Google Analytics tracking code, even if you don't add your own Google Analytics account.

### What is it?

To give you the option to opt out of Google Analytics for GDPR compliance, you can disable the default Google Analytics functionality. By disabling Google Analytics in WordPress Hosting, the tracking code that typically appears on your website will no longer be present. Additionally, any data stored on servers that was extracted from Google Analytics will be deleted, and analytics components on the interface will be hidden.

If you would like to turn Google Analytics back on, you can toggle it back on and the tracking code will be added again, data will resume being collected, and the analytics charts will resume functioning normally.

### How to Toggle the Default Google Analytics Tacking On/OFF

1\. Go to your WordPress Hosting dashboard

2\. Click on Advanced tools
