This opens the WordPress Customizer, where you can make live changes to your site.

### Step 2: Change site identity

*   In the Customizer, click **Site Identity** to:
    *   Update your **Site Title** and **Tagline**.
    *   Add or replace your site logo and favicon.

### Step 3: Customize colors and fonts

*   Look for the **Colors** or **Typography** section (options vary by theme).
*   Change the primary colors, background colors, and font styles.

### Step 4: Modify your homepage layout

1.  Navigate to **Homepage Settings** in the Customizer.
2.  Choose between:
    *   Displaying your latest posts.
    *   Using a static homepage.

### Step 5: Add Widgets

1.  Go to the **Widgets** section.
2.  Drag and drop widgets into the desired sidebar or footer area.
3.  Preview how they look in real time.

### Step 6: Customize the menu

1.  In the Customizer, select **Menus**.
2.  Create, edit, or rearrange your menu items.
3.  Assign the menu to a location (e.g., header or footer).

### Step 7: Save and publish

Once satisfied with your changes, click the **Publish** button at the top of the Customizer to save your updates.

### Tips for a smooth experience

*   **Test Responsiveness:** Check how your site looks on mobile and tablet views using the device preview option in the Customizer.
*   **Backup Your Site:** Install a backup plugin to save your changes.

By following these steps, you can customize your WordPress theme to reflect your style and needs—all without writing a single line of code!
