Password-protecting a page enhances **security and privacy** by restricting access to sensitive content. It ensures that only authorized users can view confidential information, such as **internal documents, client portals, or exclusive content**. This helps prevent **unauthorized access, data breaches, and misuse** of critical information. Additionally, it provides **controlled access** for specific users while maintaining the integrity of the website. Whether for **membership sites, private discussions, or restricted resources**, password protection is an effective way to safeguard valuable content. Below are the steps to set this up.

**Step 1: Log into the WordPress Dashboard**

**Step 2: Create a New Page or Edit an Existing One**

*   To create a new page, navigate to **Pages > Add New**.
*   If you want to password protect an existing page, go to **Pages > All Pages** and select the page you want to edit.

**Step 3: Set the Visibility to Password Protected**

*   On the right-hand side of the page editor, find the **Publish** box.
*   Click the **Edit** link next to the **Visibility** option.
*   Select **Password Protected** and then enter the password you’d like to use.

**Step 4: Update/Publish the Page**

*   After you’ve entered the password, click **OK** and then click **Publish** if it’s a new page or **Update** if you are editing an existing page.

**Step 5: Share the Password**

*   Now, only users who have the password will be able to view the page. You can share the password with those who need access.

**Notes**

*   Only people who know the password can access the page.
*   Password-protected pages are not visible in search engines unless the user has the password.
*   This feature is built into WordPress and does not require plugins.
