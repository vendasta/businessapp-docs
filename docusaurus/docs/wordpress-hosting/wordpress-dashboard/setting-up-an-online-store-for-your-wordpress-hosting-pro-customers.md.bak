For many local businesses, a viable tactic to adapt to the changing business climate is to transition to online business by setting up a simple online store. This can be as basic as providing an option to purchase a gift card that customers can redeem for services later.

For your customers with WordPress Hosting Pro or another WordPress hosting solution, we recommend [WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/). The following steps outline the basic process of setting up WooCommerce on your client’s WordPress website.

### Setting up and installing WooCommerce

1.  Go to WooCommerce.com and set up an account by selecting **_Log in with WordPress.com_**
    *   For WordPress Hosting Pro users, log in with the Vendasta account you use to manage your client’s site
    *   For clients with other WordPress hosting solutions, log in with an existing WordPress account
2.  Follow the steps. When prompted, select to **_Auto-Install WooCommerce![2.png](img/4406953671831-3587ff948e.png)_**
3.  In another tab, access your client’s WordPress dashboard. _Ensure that your client’s WordPress site is up to date._
4.  In the left menu select **Plugins > Add New**
5.  Search for the WooCommerce Plugin and **Install** it (this will take a minute)![4.png](img/4406953671831-10c9ce5f3e.png)
6.  Once installed, click to **Activate** the WooCommerce plugin![5.png](img/4406953671831-414c22de48.png)
7.  Once activated, the [WooCommerce Setup Wizard](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-setup-wizard/) will appear. You and/or your client can walk through these steps to begin setting up the store
    *   Note that the Wizard can be re-run any time from within any section of WooCommerce that has **Help** by selecting **Help > Setup Wizard** and clicking **Setup Wizard**.

Completing the Setup Wizard will require you or your client to input information about their location, currency, and preferred payment and shipping methods.

Once setup has been completed, your client can begin populating their store with the products and services that they offer. To learn more about the setup process, consult WooCommerce's [online documentation and tutorials.](https://docs.woocommerce.com/)
