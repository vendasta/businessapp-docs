## What are Plugins?

Plugins extend your WordPress site's functionality, allowing you to add features like eCommerce, contact forms, page builders, and more without writing code. WordPress Hosting supports thousands of WordPress plugins, giving you the flexibility to customize your site to meet your business needs.

## Plugin Compatibility

WordPress Hosting Pro supports most WordPress plugins, but some plugins conflict with built-in features like caching, backups, security, and email delivery. Always check the [Blacklisted and Redundant Plugins](blacklisted-and-redundant.md) guide before installing plugins that handle these features.

:::warning
Some plugins provide duplicate functionality that WordPress Hosting already includes. Installing conflicting plugins can cause performance issues, unexpected behavior, or prevent built-in features from working correctly.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

<details>
<summary>Can I install any WordPress plugin?</summary>

Most WordPress plugins work with WordPress Hosting Pro, but some plugins conflict with built-in features like caching, backups, and security. Always check the [Blacklisted and Redundant Plugins](blacklisted-and-redundant.md) guide before installing plugins that handle caching, backups, login security, or email delivery.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Why can't I use caching plugins?</summary>

WordPress Hosting includes server-side caching, so caching plugins are unnecessary and can cause conflicts. Plugin-based caching adds overhead and can interfere with WordPress Hosting's built-in features like backups and restores.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Do I need a backup plugin?</summary>

No. WordPress Hosting automatically backs up your site daily and provides on-demand backup and restore capabilities. Backup plugins are unnecessary and can slow your site's performance.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What plugins come pre-installed?</summary>

WordPress Hosting comes with Divi Builder and WooCommerce pre-installed. These plugins are fully supported and integrated with WordPress Hosting's features.
