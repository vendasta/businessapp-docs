If you do not see any email logs under the **Email History** tab in WordPress Hosting Pro, it is likely because your website is configured to use an external SMTP service ( like WP MAIL SMTP) to send emails. When external SMTP services are used, WordPress Hosting Pro cannot capture and log these emails.

### How to Enable WordPress Hosting Pro's Built-in Mail System

To ensure email logs appear under the **Email History** tab, you can switch to using WordPress Hosting Pro's built-in SendGrid mail system. Follow these steps:

1.  **Log in to the WordPress Dashboard**  
    Access the WordPress admin dashboard for your website.
    
2.  **Navigate to General Settings**
    
    *   From the left menu, click **Settings** > **General**.
3.  **Enable WordPress Hosting Pro Mail System**
    
    *   Locate the option to **Enable WordPress Hosting Pro Mail System** and check the box.
4.  **Save Changes**
    
    *   Click the **Save Changes** button to apply the new settings.

### Benefits of Using WordPress Hosting Pro Mail System

*   Automatic logging of emails sent from your website.
*   Simplified management of email logs via WordPress Hosting Pro.
