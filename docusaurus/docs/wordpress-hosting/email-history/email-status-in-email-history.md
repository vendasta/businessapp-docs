When you delve into the Activity section, you'll often encounter various email statuses. These statuses provide valuable insights into the performance of your email campaigns. Let's break down the most common ones:

### Common email statuses

*   **Processed:** This indicates that the email has been successfully processed by the system. It's a combined status of "Delivered" and "Bounced" emails.
*   **Delivered:** This means the email has been successfully delivered to the recipient's inbox.
*   **Bounced:** This signifies that the email couldn't be delivered to the recipient's inbox. This could be due to various reasons like invalid email addresses or full mailboxes.
*   **Opened:** This shows that the recipient has opened the email and viewed its content.
*   **Clicked Through:** This indicates that the recipient has clicked on a link within the email.
*   **Spam Report:** This means the recipient has marked the email as spam. This can have negative consequences for your email sender reputation.
*   **Unsubscribed:** This shows that the recipient has opted out of receiving future emails from you.
*   **Dropped:** This means the email was not sent due to various reasons like invalid email addresses, bounces, unsubscribes, or spam reports.

### A note on unsubscribed emails

**Please be cautious when encountering "Unsubscribed" statuses.** While it might seem straightforward, it's crucial to verify that the unsubscribe was intentional. Sometimes, emails might be incorrectly marked as unsubscribed due to technical glitches or user error.

**To ensure accurate unsubscribes, please reach out to our support team and provide written consent from the client directly.** This will help us maintain a clean and accurate email list.

By understanding these email statuses, you can gain valuable insights into your email campaign performance and take appropriate actions to optimize your future campaigns.
