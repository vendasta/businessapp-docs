# Create New Users

To create WordPress users using WordPress Hosting, you must create a Business App user. A WordPress user will be automatically created when you create the Business App user.

## How It Works

* Users are identified by their email address
* The Business App email address is used for WordPress login
* All users created in Business App are assigned the **Administrator** role in WordPress by default

## Example

You want to give Bob access to your WordPress website:

1. Create a Business App user for Bob with the email `bob@email.com`
2. When Bob accesses the WordPress dashboard via WordPress Hosting, he will be automatically logged in as an Administrator with the email `bob@email.com`
