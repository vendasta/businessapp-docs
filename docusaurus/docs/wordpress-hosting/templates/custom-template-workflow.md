You can create and manage custom templates through the Templates tab in WordPress Hosting Standard/Pro/Premium.

Custom templates allow you to save themes, plugins, and site content for use when creating a new site. Admin users have access to this tab, and the templates you create will be visible when creating new sites. Create and edit up to 12 of your own templates.

Creating and managing your templates is straightforward.

When creating websites, you often need to install the same set of plugins, themes, and sometimes even content repeatedly. With templates, you can save time by setting up templates as starting points for each website you create, skipping repetitive manual work and focusing on creating quality website content.

## How do custom templates work?

**Duplicate Template**

This feature lets you duplicate your existing templates, or create new ones using any of the pre-built templates as a starting point.

:::note
You can only duplicate a template that has been published. To publish a template, click on **Edit Template > Template Management > Publish as Template**.
