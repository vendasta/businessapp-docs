## What are Templates?

Templates in WordPress Hosting are pre-configured website starting points that include themes, plugins, and content. They allow you to quickly create new websites without manually installing the same plugins and themes each time. WordPress Hosting includes seven pre-built industry-specific templates, and partners can create up to 12 custom templates for their own use or to offer to customers.

Templates streamline the website creation process by automatically installing your preferred themes, plugins, and page structures, saving time and ensuring consistency across multiple sites.

## Why are Templates important?

* **Save Time**: Skip repetitive setup work by reusing templates for multiple sites
* **Consistency**: Ensure all your sites start with the same base configuration
* **Efficiency**: Front-load plugin and theme installation work once, reuse many times
* **Customization**: Create templates tailored to your specific business needs or client requirements
* **Flexibility**: Offer templates to customers for DIY website creation
