Unpublishing a WordPress website can be done in several ways depending on your goals:

## Take a Site Offline Completely

To take a site offline completely in WordPress Hosting Pro, you can cancel or deactivate the WordPress Hosting product. This removes public access and stops all future backups.

> **Note:** Deactivating a WordPress Hosting Pro product will make both the production and staging sites inaccessible and return a "site not found" error.

## Temporarily Hide a Site

To temporarily hide a site, use a maintenance mode plugin. This is useful for rebranding, major updates, or staging.

## Fully Remove a Site

To fully remove a site, you can manually delete the site's files via SFTP or use a plugin that disables public access.
