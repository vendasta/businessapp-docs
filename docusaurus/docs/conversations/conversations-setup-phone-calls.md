## Set Up Your Conversations Phone Number 

Your Conversations phone number is automatically assigned to you when you activate the Pro or Premium editions of Conversations AI. You can find this phone number by navigating to <SettingsIcon /> `Administration > Conversation Settings > Phone & SMS > Configure`. The options available to you depend on your edition of Conversations AI.

### Call Receiving Settings in Conversations AI

When someone calls your Conversations phone number, you can choose what happens using the **When a call is received...** dropdown in your settings.

#### End call
The call is automatically disconnected.

- ***(Optional)* Play a voice message before ending the call:**  
  Enable this to play a short, custom text-to-speech message (e.g., “Sorry we missed you!”) before the call disconnects.

#### Forward the call
Calls to your Conversations number are forwarded to another phone number you specify (such as your main office, personal cell, or a team member).

- **Enter the number in the `Forward to` field.**
- **Set up SMS follow-up for forwarded calls:**
  - **Immediately:** An SMS is sent as soon as the call is forwarded.
  - **If the forwarded call is missed:** An SMS is only sent if the forwarded call is not answered (e.g., disconnects or receives a busy tone). Calls answered by voicemail are considered "answered" and won’t trigger a text back.

#### Answer with AI (Premium only)
The AI Voice Receptionist will answer, greet, and engage with the caller as configured in your AI settings. 

> **Note:** For setup and advanced AI options see [AI Voice Receptionist Guide](../ai/ai-workforce/ai-voice-receptionist.md).

#### Additional SMS options
For all three scenarios, you can enable **Follow up with an SMS message**:
- Toggle on this setting to automatically send a custom text after a call ends or is missed.
- Customize your SMS message in the “Message to send” 
   - Example: `Thanks for calling [Your Business Name]. Feel free to message us back if you have any further questions.`

## Additional Step: Enable the AI Voice Receptionist (Premium Only)

1. Go to **AI Workforce > AI Voice Receptionist > Configure**
2. Check **"Phone call: Answer with Voice AI"** and save
3. Customize your AI greeting, voice, and business knowledge as needed
4. Test by calling your Conversations number

For advanced AI configuration (scripts, voice family, multi-language), see [AI Voice Receptionist Guide](../ai/ai-workforce/ai-voice-receptionist.md).

### What Happens When AI Voice Receptionist Answers Calls (Premium Only)
Once your AI Voice Receptionist is set up to receive calls from your Conversations phone number:

- All phone conversations appear in your Conversations dashboard 
- Call recordings and transcripts are automatically generated 
- Lead information is saved directly to your CRM 
- Team members can review conversations and 
- Follow-up actions can be triggered through Automations

### Call Forwarding Setup in Conversations (Optional)

If you want your main business number to be answered by Conversations (or by the AI Voice Receptionist), you can set up call forwarding from your existing number to your Conversations phone number.

Most mobile carriers (AT&T, T-Mobile, Rogers, Bell, Telus, and many others) support simple star-codes to enable forwarding. In-platform, you’ll find a helpful guide in your Conversations phone settings that shows:
- Activation and cancel codes for your provider
- Step-by-step setup instructions, including confirmation steps
- How to forward calls if you don’t answer, if your phone is off or has no signal, or if you’re on another call

**How to access call forwarding instructions:**
1. Go to <SettingsIcon />`Settings > Conversations Settings > Phone & SMS > Configure` in Business App.
2. Check the **call forwarding help section** for up-to-date activation and cancel codes and step-by-step guidance.
3. Test your setup by calling your business number from another phone.
4. To turn off forwarding later, use the cancel code in the help section or dial `#004#` to reset your phone’s settings.

> **Tip:** The call forwarding section in your Conversations settings always shows the latest carrier-specific instructions and codes, so check there for the most accurate info.
