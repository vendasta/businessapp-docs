You can use Conversations to send and receive emails with leads and customers from a shared email address. As long as you have the email address for a contact, anyone on the team can send an email to that customer from your centralized Conversations and keep message history in one shared place.


## Sender, Reply, and Forwarding settings for email in Conversations

### Conversations Email Sender Address

Conversations uses a shared email address to keep all customer conversations in one place. When you send a message, it appears to come from your business's assigned email (like `reply+xxxxx@businessapp.io`), but the sender's name and signature are visible to the customer. This helps your team collaborate without confusion over who sent what.

### Conversations Email Reply-to Routing

The reply-to feature ensures that responses from customers are automatically directed back to the shared Conversations thread. When a customer replies, their response lands in the same conversation where any team member can continue the discussion.

### Conversations Email Forwarding Settings

By setting up email forwarding, you can receive incoming messages from your existing business email (e.g., `team@yourcompany.com`) directly into Conversations. Use the tabs below for detailed setup instructions per provider.
