### Troubleshooting your web chat widget installation 

If the Conversations web chat widget does not appear on your site after installation there are a couple of things you might be able to do yourself to make it appear:

#### 1. Clear your browser cache

- **Browser cache:** Force your browser to load the newest version of your site.
  - Mac: `Shift` + `Command` + `R`
  - PC: `Ctrl` + `F5`
- **Website hosting cache:** Clear your website’s cache (e.g., use the “Flush Cache” button if available in your website platform).
- **WordPress/Divi cache:** If using the Divi theme, go to Theme Options > Builder > Advanced and disable “Static CSS File Generation.”
- **Other cache plugins:** Temporarily disable any cache plugins and refresh your site.

#### 2. Check your widget code placement

Ensure the widget installation code is pasted in the correct location:
- The code must be inside the `<head>` section of your site’s HTML (not the `<body>` or a widget block).
- For WordPress, double-check if the plugin is active, or if you pasted the code into the correct theme section.

#### 3. Check your hosting platform for plugin or theme conflicts

- Disable other plugins or custom code temporarily to see if something is blocking the widget.
- If you find a conflict, try re-enabling plugins one by one to isolate the issue.

## How Will I Be Notified About a New Lead?

When your AI assistant is successful in capturing a name and contact info, a few things will happen automatically:

1. A new contact is added to your CRM Contacts, with the captured info: First name, last name, phone number, and email address.
   * If a lead updates their contact info in the AI-assisted web chat (like for example, if they make a mistake), the latest contact info will be updated on the contact automatically.
2. A "New lead" email notification is sent to users on your account. Make sure you have notifications enabled for new leads.

## Customization Options

You can tailor the web chat widget to align with your branding and operational needs:

- **Color Scheme**: Adjust the primary and secondary colors to match your website's design.
- **Web Chat Greeting**: Customize the initial message to encourage visitor interaction.
- **AI Knowledge Base**: Enhance the assistant's responses by adding specific business information, such as FAQs, pricing, and services.
- **Profile Information**: Add a name and profile photo to personalize the assistant.
- **Welcome Greeting**: Set a header message to invite engagement.
- **Initial AI Message**: Configure a custom greeting that appears shortly after the chat is opened.
- **Phone Configuration**: Define how received calls and SMS messages should be handled.

Access these settings via Administration > Conversations Settings > Configure Web Chat`.

## FAQs About AI Web Chat in Conversations

<details>
<summary><strong>Can the AI assistant scrape websites for information?</strong></summary>

Yes, the AI can be trained on website content to enhance its knowledge base.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I upload files like PDFs or DOCs for the AI to learn from?</strong></summary>

Currently, only raw text can be added to the AI's knowledge base.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why is the AI responding with incorrect or incomplete information?</strong></summary>

The information the AI responds to inquiries with is based on the source information it has only. The web chat tool shows you directly inside the Conversations chat record where it got the source information from, like a quick audit. You can then make the change on your website or inside your AI knowledge base. The most common culprit is old or incorrect information found on the website.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How long does training the AI take?</strong></summary>

Training duration varies based on website size but typically takes between 1-5 minutes.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is there a limit to the number of AI responses?</strong></summary>

No, unlimited AI responses are included with Conversations Pro.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How do I install the web chat widget?</strong></summary>

Copy and paste the installation code into the `<head>` section of your website's HTML. Detailed instructions are provided above.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What languages does the AI support?</strong></summary>

The AI assistant can respond in over 40 languages, including English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Turkish, Polish, Ukrainian, Russian, Japanese, and Chinese.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why won't the chat widget let me type certain letters or the "Space" key when trying to type?</strong></summary>

Some plugins can interfere with the ability to type in the widget because they “hijack” that key for their own functions.

For example, website admins will have trouble typing messages into the web chat widget when the WordPress Jetpack plugin is enabled because it hijacks some of the keys to open and close their own chat functions. Disabling the JetPack plugin will restore the function of these keys.

Smooth scrolling website features can also interfere with the ability of your website visitors to type the ‘space’ key with the web chat widget. If you have the Divi theme on a WordPress website, you can disable smooth scrolling by going to Divi > Theme Options and disabling the Smooth Scrolling functions.

<details>
<summary><strong>How do I remove the Google reCaptcha badge that's blocking my chat widget?</strong></summary>

When reCAPTCHA is being used on a website form, this badge will appear in the bottom right of a webpage – which could be in the way of the web chat widget.

You can hide the badge completely on your website with some custom CSS; just make sure to follow Google’s required alternative ways to inform the user that reCAPTCHA is being used.
