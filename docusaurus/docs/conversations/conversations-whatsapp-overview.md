## Sending WhatsApp Messages

Your options for sending a WhatsApp message are different based on your conversation history with your customer:
- If you are sending a WhatsApp message to someone who ***has* contacted you first**, you are free to write any message that meets WhatsApp guidelines.
- If you are sending a p messsage to someone who **has *not* contact you first**, you must reply using a WhatsApp template. 

If your account is new and does not yet have any templates, the system will automatically submit a template for approval on your behalf. You can also create and submit additional templates anytime through the [Meta Business Help Center](https://business.facebook.com/latest/whatsapp_manager/message_templates).

:::info
Only approved templated messages can be sent as outbound cold messages. Once a customer initiates contact, you can reply with custom messages within a 24-hour window.

## Getting WhatsApp Replies

- Customer replies to your WhatsApp Business account automatically appear in the same Conversations thread
- All WhatsApp history is retained alongside other channels like email, SMS, and web chat

## Additional WhatsApp Features Managed by Meta

Some advanced features and upgrades are controlled directly by Meta (WhatsApp's parent company). We provide this information to help you understand these options and how to access them.

## FAQs About WhatsApp Messaging in Conversations

<details>
<summary><strong>Can a client connect an existing WhatsApp business account to Conversations, and still use the mobile app?</strong></summary>

Not currently. WhatsApp is working on a feature called "WhatsApp Coexistence," which is in closed beta. If a business has a WhatsApp for business account on their phone already, they can register a new (second) account for using with Conversations. In the future, we hope to support 'coexistence' as well.
