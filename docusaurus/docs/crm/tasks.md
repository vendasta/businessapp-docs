Tasks help you plan and track the actions required to move deals forward—calls, emails, follow-ups, and more.

:::tip
Use tags and priority to organize your daily queue, then save a view for today’s focus tasks.

### View and Filter Tasks

1. Go to `CRM` > `Tasks`.
2. Click `Add filter` to filter tasks and save common filters as `Views`.

:::note
Views are personal by default. Name them clearly so you can reuse them.

### Edit, Complete, or Delete Tasks

Within a CRM record’s activity timeline:

- Complete: check the task checkbox, or use `Mark as complete` if shown.
- Edit: open the task menu (kebab), choose `Edit activity`, make changes, and save.

From the task table:

- View: click the task name.
- Edit: kebab menu > `Edit task`, update fields, and save.
- Delete: kebab menu > `Delete task`, and confirm.
- Complete: change status in the `Task status` column.

### Work Faster with Task Queue

1. Go to `CRM` > `Tasks` and apply filters or open a saved view.
2. Click `Start [x] tasks` to work through them consecutively.
3. For each task, choose: `Mark as complete`, `Reschedule`, or `Skip`. Use the association dropdown to jump between linked records. Exit the queue any time and resume from the table.

:::info
The task queue works best with a narrowly filtered set of tasks (same type or segment) to reduce context switching.
