## Overview

Upload files—PDFs, images, documents, spreadsheets, and more—and associate them with any **[Contact](./contacts)**, **[Company](./companies)**, or **[Opportunity](./opportunities)** in CRM. After upload, an **AI-generated summary** of the file content appears automatically.

  Structured file data enables better search and AI-driven engagement.
