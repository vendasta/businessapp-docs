To import your WordPress sites into WordPress Hosting Pro, follow these steps:

**1\. Create an Account**

Go to the [Accounts](https://partners.vendasta.com/manage-accounts) tab in Partner Center and create an account for each of your clients. All you’ll need is a single piece of business information—like their business name—and our system will find the rest. ([Instructions](https://support.vendasta.com/hc/en-us/articles/4406959813911))

*   If you are on any of the paid subscriptions, you can also import your accounts via the [Lists](https://partners.vendasta.com/action-lists/manage?marketId=default) tab in Partner Center. ([Instructions](https://support.vendasta.com/hc/en-us/articles/4406958467607))

**2\. Activate WordPress Hosting**

Select the account in Partner Center and activate WordPress Hosting Pro. ([Instructions](https://support.vendasta.com/hc/en-us/articles/4406958134807))

*   You can use the Lists tab in Partner Center to do this for every account at once (if you're on a paid subscription).

**3\. Create a New Site**

For each account in Partner Center, launch WordPress Hosting and create a site. All you’ll need is their name, tagline, and domain.

**4\. Migrate the Old Site**

**Option A: DIY**

Use a plugin like [All-in-One WP Migration](https://en-ca.wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-wp-migration/) to migrate your WordPress sites. ([Instructions](https://help.websitepro.hosting/?p=302))

**Option B: Do It For Me**

If you’d like Vendasta to migrate your sites for you:

1.  Submit **[this form](https://website-pro-migration.websitepro.hosting/)** to provide us with key details about your migration.
2.  A member of our WordPress Hosting team will email you to begin the migration.
3.  We'll move a copy of each site to WordPress Hosting and put it on a temporary domain.
4.  You’ll repoint the domains and DNS records to WordPress Hosting.
