### How to download your theme

All your items are available for you to download via your download page.

1.  On the Envato Elements home page, hover over the main menu
2.  Select [My](https://elements.envato.com/account/downloads) [Downloads](https://elements.envato.com/account/downloads)
3.  Select the item you want to download
4.  Click ‘Download’
5.  Choose whether to license the item for [Project Use or Trial Use](https://help.elements.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000629226--Trial-Use-versus-Project-Use-licenses). If you're downloading the item again for a project that you've already registered (as you lost the download), simply choose 'Trial Use' to obtain the download again. You can also [relicense](https://help.elements.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000621763-Relicense-Items) an item.
6.  Your download will now begin

Your download contains **all files and documentation**, you will need to extract the files provided in the zip file to locate the **installable WordPress file.**

Check your downloads folder, you should see something similar to the example below.

Make sure you select the zip file which has the title of the theme you’ve purchased. You can find this file by searching for the file which has your theme name and the zip extension. For e.g. we’ve downloaded the ‘Krobs - Personal Onepage Responsive WordPress’ theme, so the file is titled krobs.zip’ (themename.zip).
