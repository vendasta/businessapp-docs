WordPress is popular, which makes it a target for hackers. While WordPress provides security updates, it is also recommended that users also need to take extra steps to protect their sites from cyberattacks.

### Common Threats & Risks

*   **Weak passwords** – Hackers try different password combinations to break in.
*   **Malicious code (XSS & SQL injection)** – Attackers insert harmful code into your site through plugins or forms.
*   **DDoS attacks** – Too much fake traffic slows or crashes your site.
*   **Outdated software** – Old WordPress versions, themes, and plugins can be exploited.

### How to Secure Your WordPress Site

1\. **Protect Your Login Page**

*   Change the default WordPress login URL (e.g., from `/wp-admin` to something unique).
*   Use **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** for extra security.
*   Limit failed login attempts to stop brute force attacks.

2\. **Keep Everything Updated**

*   Regularly update WordPress, themes, and plugins.
*   Only use trusted plugins and themes from the WordPress directory.

3\. **Install Security Plugins**

Use security plugins like Wordfence or Sucuri to block threats, scan for malware, and enable firewalls.

4\. **Secure Your Website Data**

*   Install an **SSL certificate** to encrypt data.
*   Hide your WordPress version to prevent attackers from exploiting known weaknesses.

5\. **Control User Access**

*   Only give admin access to trusted users.
*   Delete inactive user accounts.
*   Log out inactive users automatically.

6\. **Regular Backups & Monitoring**

*   Monitor site activity and scan for malware regularly.

Following these steps can help keep your WordPress website safe from hackers and cyber threats.
