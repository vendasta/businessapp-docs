Divi is a popular WordPress theme and page builder plugin developed by Elegant Themes, offering a flexible and powerful design experience. Whether you're building websites from scratch or customizing existing ones, Divi makes it easy to create beautiful, responsive sites without the need for coding expertise. In this article, we will explain what Divi is, how it works on the WordPress Hosting Pro platform, and whether you need both the Divi plugin and theme.

### What is the Divi Theme?

The **Divi theme** is a fully customizable WordPress theme that determines the layout, design, and overall appearance of your website. Divi is especially well-known for its **drag-and-drop visual builder**, which allows users to design pages with ease and without writing any code.

### What is the Divi Plugin?

The **Divi Builder plugin** is a standalone plugin that brings Divi’s page-building functionality to any WordPress theme. While the Divi theme already integrates the Divi Builder, the plugin allows you to add the page-building features to other themes.

If you are using a different theme but want to take advantage of Divi’s page-building tools, the Divi Builder plugin is the solution. 

### How Does Divi Work on the WordPress Hosting Pro Platform?

WordPress Hosting Pro is a hosting platform that streamlines the process of building and managing websites. When you create a site on WordPress Hosting Pro, **Divi licenses are included by default** if you select a Divi template to design your site, so you don’t need to worry about purchasing a separate license for Divi.

Here’s how Divi works on WordPress Hosting Pro:

*   **Automatic Divi License**: When you design your site using a Divi template on WordPress Hosting Pro, the Divi theme license is automatically provided. You don’t need to manually purchase a separate Divi license.
*   **Seamless Compatibility**: WordPress Hosting Pro fully supports both the Divi theme and Divi Builder plugin, making it easy to design responsive, beautiful websites with minimal effort.

However, WordPress Hosting **Pro only provides the default Divi theme license**. If you need additional add-ons or premium features for Divi, you will need to purchase those separately through Elegant Themes or other providers.

For more information and detailed documentation on how to use Divi, you can visit the official **[Elegant Themes Documentation](https://www.elegantthemes.com/documentation/)**.

### Do I Need to Install Both the Divi Theme and Divi Plugin?

You do not need to install both the Divi theme and the Divi Builder plugin unless you want to combine their features.

*   **If you are using the Divi theme**: Simply install and activate the Divi theme. The Divi Builder plugin is integrated with the theme, so there is no need to install the plugin separately.
*   **If you are using another theme**: You can install the Divi Builder plugin and use it alongside your chosen theme to access Divi’s page-building functionality.

### Conclusion

Divi is an excellent solution for building customizable, responsive WordPress websites, and it works seamlessly with the WordPress Hosting Pro platform. WordPress Hosting Pro offers a default Divi theme license with each new website you create, so you don’t have to worry about purchasing Divi separately. However, for additional add-ons or premium features, you will need to acquire those licenses separately from Elegant Themes.

Whether you choose to use the Divi theme or the Divi Builder plugin depends on your preferences and needs. By combining Divi with WordPress on WordPress Hosting Pro, you get a powerful and flexible solution for creating professional websites with ease.
