### Where can I access form submissions?

Once the plugin is activated, a new menu item called **"Divi Form DB"** will appear in the WordPress dashboard.

### How do I view a form submission?

Go to **Divi Form DB** and click **"View Form Submission"** to see the details.

### Why can’t I see all form fields?

The free version only supports fields with IDs: **name, email, and message**. To view all fields, upgrade to the **Pro version**. If you're using Pro and still facing issues, submit a support request.[](https://youtu.be/02jkCpG1kXA)
