WordPress Hosting Pro and WordPress HostingStandard both offer flexible site-building tools, including a selection of pre-built templates and full support for custom designs. This article covers how to use, customize, and import templates, and where to find help with Divi Builder.

#### **Q: Can I import my own custom templates to WordPress Hosting Standard or WordPress Hosting Pro?**

Yes. You can create custom templates by importing an existing WordPress site and saving it as a new template in WordPress Hosting Pro or Standard.

#### Steps to create and import a custom template:

1.  **Export your existing WordPress site:**
    
    *   In the WordPress dashboard of the site you want to use as a template, install the **All-in-One WP Migration** plugin.
        
    *   Go to **All-in-One WP Migration > Export** and download your site file.
        
2.  **Create a new template in WordPress Hosting Pro/Standard:**
    
    *   Navigate to WordPress Hosting **> Templates** in the dashboard.
        
    *   Create or duplicate a template.
        
    *   Enter the WordPress dashboard for that template and install the **All-in-One WP Migration** plugin again.
        
3.  **Import the site into the template:**
    
    *   Go to **All-in-One WP Migration > Import** and upload the exported file from Step 1.
        
    *   Once imported, return to the **Template Overview** page and click **Publish as Template** or **Update Template**.
        

#### Best practices for template performance:

*   Keep your templates simple.
    
*   Avoid bundling more than **30 plugins**.
    
*   Minimize large media uploads inside the template.
    
*   Treat templates as a **starting point**; additional customizations can be made on a per-site basis after launch.
    

#### **Q: Where can I find help articles and documentation for Divi?**
