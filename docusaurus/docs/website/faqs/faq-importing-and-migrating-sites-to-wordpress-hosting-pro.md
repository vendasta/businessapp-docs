WordPress Hosting Pro supports fast and flexible import options for WordPress websites. This article covers the most frequently asked questions around importing existing sites, file size limitations, user access after migration, and supported CMS platforms.

#### **Q: Can I import a WordPress site into WordPress Hosting Pro?**

Yes! There are two main ways to import a WordPress site:

**Option 1: Use All-in-One WP Migration Plugin**

*   This is the easiest option for most users.
    
*   Export your site from the original host and import it into WordPress Hosting Pro via the plugin.
    
*   WordPress Hosting Pro templates already include the plugin by default.
    

**Option 2: Manual Import (for advanced users)**

You can manually import your site if:

*   The backup file is too large
    
*   You're using a format not supported by plugins
    

#### **Q: How do I import a WordPress site using the All-in-One WP Migration plugin?**

WordPress Hosting Pro makes migrating an existing WordPress site easy using the **All-in-One WP Migration** plugin.

Here’s how to do it:

1.  1.  **On your original site:**
        
        *   Install and activate the **All-in-One WP Migration** plugin.
            
        *   Go to **All-in-One WP Migration > Export**.
            
        *   Choose your export destination (e.g., File) and download the full export. This includes your database, media, plugins, and themes.
            
    2.  **In WordPress Hosting Pro:**
        
        *   Launch the WordPress Dashboard.
            
        *   Install and activate the **All-in-One WP Migration** plugin again.
            
        *   Navigate to **All-in-One WP Migration > Import**.
            
        *   Upload the `.wpress` file you just exported from your old site.
            
    3.  **That’s it!**  
        Once the import finishes, your WordPress site will be fully restored inside WordPress Hosting Pro — content, design, and functionality included.
        

**Steps for manual import:**

1.  Backup your files and database from your old host.
    
2.  Upload files via **SFTP** to WordPress Hosting Pro.
    
3.  Import your `.sql` database via **phpMyAdmin** in Advanced Tools.
    
4.  Use a tool like **Search and Replace** to update any domain references in the database.
    
5.  Connect your domain to WordPress Hosting Pro via the Domains tab.
    

See the manual import steps below for a full walkthrough.

#### **Q: What if my backup file is larger than 512MB?**

The free version of **All-in-One WP Migration** supports up to 64MB. If your file is larger:

**Option 1: Use the extended plugin version**

*   Download the 512MB-capable version and upload it manually to your WordPress site.
    

**Option 2: Upgrade to Unlimited**

*   Buy the **Unlimited Extension** ($69 one-time, use on unlimited sites)
    
*   Or contact Vendasta Support and we’ll upload it for you at no cost.
    

#### Option 3: Use another migration plugin

Other WordPress migration plugins are also supported if you prefer an alternative.

#### **Q: Can I import a Squarespace website into WordPress Hosting Pro?**

Yes — **with limitations**. Squarespace allows exporting into a WordPress-compatible format, but some features and styles may not fully transfer.

**Steps to migrate:**

1.  In Squarespace, go to **Settings > Advanced > Import/Export**
    
2.  Choose **Export**, then click the **WordPress** icon
    
3.  In WordPress, go to **Tools > Import**, and choose the Squarespace file
    
4.  Run the importer and complete the process
    

Expect to re-style or rebuild elements that do not transfer exactly.

#### **Q: Can I import or migrate a Wix website to WordPress Hosting Pro?**

**No.** Wix is a proprietary website builder and does not support exporting into WordPress-compatible formats.

If your client is on Wix:

*   You’ll need to **rebuild their site manually** in WordPress using WordPress Hosting Pro
    
*   Consider using similar themes or recreating layouts with page builders like Divi or Elementor
    

#### **Q: Can I import a `.zip` backup file (e.g., from Duplicator) directly?**

No. WordPress Hosting Pro supports `.wpress` files used by **All-in-One WP Migration**, but **.zip files cannot be converted** to `.wpress`.

**Alternative:**  
Follow the manual import process using SFTP and phpMyAdmin.

#### **Q: What happens to WordPress users after a site import?**

By default, users from the imported WordPress site **won’t be able to log in**. To preserve access:

**Option 1:**

*   Delete existing users and create **Business App users** for everyone who needs access.
    
*   When they log in via Business App, a matching WordPress user will be created automatically.
    

**Option 2:**

*   Create a Business App user **with the same email** as each WordPress user you want to preserve.
    

> Emails must match exactly. `bob@email.com` and `robert@email.com` are considered different users.
