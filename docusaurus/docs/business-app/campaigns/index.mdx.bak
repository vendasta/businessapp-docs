Campaigns are multi‑step, email marketing sequences you can design, schedule, and send to targeted CRM contacts and lists. You can personalize content, automate timing, and measure performance (sends, opens, clicks, unsubscribes) to improve results over time.

Campaigns help you send the right message to the right people at the right time. Use email marketing campaigns in Business App to deliver sequences of emails to contacts associated with your companies, nurture relationships, announce promotions, and drive engagement—all from within the CRM‑connected platform.
