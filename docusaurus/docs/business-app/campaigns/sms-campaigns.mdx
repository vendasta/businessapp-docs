# SMS campaigns in Business App

SMS campaigns let you reach your audience with text messages directly from Business App. This guide explains how to create and manage SMS campaigns.

## SMS add-on requirement

Campaigns Pro does not include SMS in the base plan. To send SMS campaigns, you need to purchase an SMS add-on. The base plan includes email campaigns (for example, 10,000 emails per month) but not SMS credits.

**Key points:**

- SMS sending requires a separate SMS add-on; credits are not included by default.
- Without the add-on, the SMS campaign option is locked and you’ll be prompted to purchase it.
- SMS add-ons provide a set number of messages per month (for example, 100 or 500 depending on the add-on).
- The Campaigns Pro SMS add-on is separate from SMS credits used by other products (such as Reputation AI).
- You can use Inbox Pro to reply to SMS if it’s enabled, but sending bulk SMS campaigns requires the Campaigns Pro SMS add-on.

SMS add-ons are only available in the United States and Canada.

## Tips for successful SMS campaigns

- Keep messages short and clear because of character limits.
- Include a clear call-to-action.
- Schedule sends at reasonable times (avoid very early or late).
- Always include an opt-out option to stay compliant.
- Test with a small group before sending to your full list.

## Legal compliance

When sending SMS campaigns, follow applicable rules:
