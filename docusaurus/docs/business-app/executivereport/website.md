## What is the Website section?

The **Website** section of the Executive Report shows how your website is performing. If you use Website Standard/Pro (WordPress) or connect Google Analytics, you’ll see traffic, engagement, and referral data in one place—alongside the rest of your marketing in the report.

## Why it’s useful

The Executive Report brings your key marketing results together. The Website section lets you see your site’s performance next to reviews, SEO, leads, and more, so you can track progress and see how your site is contributing. When Google Analytics is connected, you get stronger metrics on traffic, where visitors come from, and how they behave on your site.

## How it works

### Website Pro (WordPress)

Website performance appears in the Executive Report when Website Standard/Pro is active for your account and your WordPress site is connected.

### Google Analytics

You can add more detail by connecting Google Analytics:

1. Go to **Business App** > **Administration** > **Connections**
2. Open **Browse Integrations** and add **Google Analytics**
3. Complete the connection steps

Once connected, Google Analytics data appears in the **Website** section of the Executive Report.

## Metrics you can see

With Google Analytics connected, the report can show:

- **Users** — Unique visitors to your site
- **Sessions** — Total visits to your site
- **Page views** — Total pages viewed
- **Average time on site** — How long people stay
- **Bounce rate** — Percentage of visitors who leave after one page
- **Pages per session** — How many pages people view per visit
- **Traffic sources** — How people find your site (search, direct, social, etc.)
- **Top referral sources** — Which sites send you the most traffic

## What you need to set up

- **Website Pro data** — Website Standard/Pro active for your account and WordPress site connected
- **Google Analytics data** — Connect Google Analytics in **Business App** > **Administration** > **Connections** > **Browse Integrations**

Both give you useful website performance data in your Executive Report.
