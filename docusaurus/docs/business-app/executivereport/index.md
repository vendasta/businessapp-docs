## What is the Executive Report?
The **Executive Report** gives you a clear summary of your business’s online performance across key marketing areas like reviews, SEO, social media, listings, advertising, and website traffic. The report is automatically generated and delivered on a weekly or monthly schedule and includes data from the tools connected to your Business App.

This report helps you understand your results over time and track growth without needing to gather data from multiple tools manually.

## Why is the Executive Report Important?
As a business owner, you need a clear way to understand how your online presence and marketing efforts are performing. The **Executive Report** gives you a simple, reliable summary of your most important metrics—without the need to log into multiple tools or spreadsheets.

Each report helps you:
- See how many **people saw your business** across listings, search, social, and ads (impressions)
- Understand where and how customers **engage with your content**, like social posts, reviews, or ads
- Track **leads and conversions**, such as phone calls, website visits, and clicks from campaigns

This report consolidates your data into one view, so you can make smart business decisions faster:
- Identify what’s working and what needs improvement
- Stay aware of week-over-week and month-over-month trends
- Avoid jumping between platforms to track performance

## When Is New Data Updated in the Executive Report

Data appears in your Executive Report automatically as your connected products collect and sync performance results. Data from Google Business Profile typically shows up within about 5 minutes after you connect it. If you recently added a product, it may take up to 48 hours for data to appear in your next report.

## When you’ll receive the report

- **Monthly report** — Usually sent between the 1st and 3rd of each month. The report is tied to the start of the month, so it may arrive on a weekend or holiday.
- **Weekly report** — Sent on Mondays.
- **Processing delay** — Because the report pulls in a lot of data, you may see a 2–3 day delay before your monthly report arrives. That’s normal and ensures the numbers are complete and accurate.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Why isn’t Google Search Console data showing in my Executive Report?</summary>

Google Search Console (GSC) helps track how your website appears in Google Search results. A few reasons its data might not appear yet:

- **Connection timing** — Data collection begins only after GSC is connected to your Business App account. If you recently connected it, allow a few days for the initial data to populate.
- **Daily sync** — GSC data is pulled into the Executive Report once per day, typically around midnight CST. Changes may take up to 24 hours to appear.
- **New website** — If your site just went live, there may not be enough search traffic yet for GSC to report. New sites often need time before data is available.
- **No data in GSC** — Check Google Search Console directly. If GSC shows no data, the Executive Report won’t display that section either.

If you’ve checked these and the issue persists, additional investigation may be required.
