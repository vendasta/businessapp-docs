## What is the Reputation section?

The Executive Report includes a **Reputation** section so you can see how your business is performing on reviews and reputation. A main part of this is the **Review Grade**—a letter grade that summarizes your online review presence and how it compares to others in your industry.

## Review Grade

The **Review Grade** is a letter grade (A through F) that reflects your business’s online review presence. It helps you see at a glance how you’re doing and track improvement over time.

### How is the Review Grade calculated?

The grade is based on four areas:

- **Average review score** — Your typical star rating
- **Number of review sources** — How many sites you’re getting reviews on
- **Reviews found** — How many reviews were found for your business
- **Reviews per month** — How many new reviews you’re getting

Those four are combined and compared to the industry average. The result is a letter grade using this scale:

- **A** = 90th–100th percentile (top 10%)
- **B** = 75th–89th percentile
- **C** = 50th–74th percentile
- **D** = 30th–49th percentile
- **F** = 0th–29th percentile

*Example: If your average review score is 3.5 and the industry average is 4.32, that category might fall in a lower percentile and pull the grade down. The same logic applies to the other three categories to produce one overall Review Grade.*

The Review Grade is on by default. If you don’t see it or want to change whether it appears, your provider can adjust that in the report settings.
