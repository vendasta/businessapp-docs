## What is the Advertising section?

If you use Advertising Intelligence, you can view performance summaries for your Facebook Ads and Google Ads accounts in the Executive Report in Business App. This section gives you a single view of your advertising performance across both platforms.

## Why is it useful?

You can see what’s happening across your ad channels in one place. That makes it easier to see which ads are performing well and to track ROI without switching between platforms. The report combines performance data with comparison periods (week-over-week or month-over-month) so you can track trends and the value of your advertising.

### Metrics you can view

- **ROI** – Return on investment across your ad channels
- **Spend** – Total advertising spend
- **Impressions** – How many times your ads were displayed
- **Clicks** – Number of clicks on your ads
- **Conversions** – Actions people took (purchases, sign-ups, etc.)
- **Comparisons** – Week-over-week or month-over-month performance

## How to see advertising in the Executive Report

### Prerequisites

- Advertising Intelligence must be active on your account
- Your ad accounts must be connected in Advertising Intelligence

### Connect your ad accounts

1. With Advertising Intelligence active, connect your Facebook Ads and/or Google Ads accounts in the product.
2. Go to the **Executive Report** in Business App and choose a time period.
3. In the **Advertising** section, you’ll see **Facebook Ads** and **Google Ads** (depending on which accounts are connected).

### Viewing performance data

In the Executive Report, the Advertising section shows a summary of your Google Ads and Facebook Ads campaigns in one place so you can review performance across both platforms.

## When data updates

Advertising data in the Executive Report is updated every Sunday, starting the week after you connect an account. You’ll get regular updates so you can track performance over time.

## Supported platforms

The Executive Report can show advertising data from:

- **Google Ads** (via Advertising Intelligence)
- **Facebook Ads** (via Advertising Intelligence)

Both provide the same core metrics (ROI, spend, impressions, clicks, conversions) and comparison data so you can see how your advertising is performing.
