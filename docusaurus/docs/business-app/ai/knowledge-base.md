The Knowledge Base is where you centralize all the information your AI Employees need to provide accurate, helpful responses to your customers. Think of it as the shared library that all your AI team members can reference when answering questions about your business.

## What is your Knowledge Base?

Your Knowledge Base is a collection of information sources that your AI Employees can access during conversations. This includes:

- **Business Profile Information** - Your basic business details, hours, location, and services
- **Website Content** - Pages from your website that contain relevant customer information
- **Custom Documents** - Uploaded files like FAQs, price lists, policies, or procedures
- **Manual Knowledge Entries** - Custom text you've written specifically for your AI team

## How AI Employees Use Knowledge

When a customer asks a question, your AI Employee:
1. Understands what the customer is asking
2. Searches through your Knowledge Base for relevant information
3. Provides an accurate answer based on your business information
4. Falls back to general assistance if no specific knowledge is found

## Benefits of a Well-Maintained Knowledge Base

- **Consistent Answers** - All AI Employees give the same accurate information
- **Reduced Training Time** - New AI Employees instantly have access to business knowledge
- **Better Customer Experience** - Customers get precise, up-to-date answers
- **Time Savings** - Less need for human intervention in routine inquiries

## Best Practices

### Keep Information Current
- Review and update your Knowledge Base regularly
- Remove outdated pricing, policies, or service information
- Add new products, services, or procedures as they become available

### Organize by Topic
- Group related information together
- Use clear, descriptive titles for documents
- Create separate entries for different aspects of your business

### Write for AI Understanding
- Use clear, direct language
- Include specific details and examples
- Avoid ambiguous terms or internal jargon

### Test and Iterate
- Monitor how your AI Employees use the knowledge
- Identify gaps where customers aren't getting good answers
- Add missing information based on common questions

## Getting Started

To build an effective Knowledge Base:

1. **Start with the basics** - Add your business profile and key website pages
2. **Identify common questions** - What do customers ask most often?
3. **Create targeted content** - Write specific answers for frequent inquiries
4. **Test with your AI** - See how well your AI can answer questions with the current knowledge
5. **Expand gradually** - Add more detailed information as you identify gaps

A strong Knowledge Base is the foundation of effective AI Employee performance. The time you invest in creating comprehensive, accurate knowledge sources will pay dividends in better customer interactions and reduced manual support needs.

## Frequently Asked Questions
