## Overview

## Why is this important?
- You can make better updates to your content and capabilities when you know how answers are generated.
- Clear expectations reduce confusion about model names, versions, or how they change over time.

## What’s included
- Where AI Employees get information
- Model disclosure policy
- Guidance to improve responses
- Frequently asked questions

## How AI Employees generate answers
AI Employees use a large language model (LLM) to draft responses based on:
- Your configured capabilities. See [Configure capabilities](ai-capabilities/configuring-capabilities.md).
- Your knowledge base content, including uploaded files and website sources. See [Knowledge base](./knowledge-base.md).
- Conversation context from the active chat, call, or task.

:::warning
Do not add sensitive or unnecessary personal data to your knowledge base. Only include information you want the assistant to use in replies.
:::

## Model disclosure policy
- We do not publish the specific LLM provider or model version used in production.
- Model options may change over time to improve quality, safety, and reliability.
- AI Chat Receptionist and AI Voice Receptionist automatically use a supported model. AI Employees let you choose from the supported models listed in Business App (the provider name is not shown).
- The base LLM infrastructure is shared, but your account data is isolated. Your content is not visible to other businesses.

## Improve response quality
1. Review your knowledge base for accuracy and completeness.
2. Keep capability instructions short, specific, and action‑oriented.
3. Test common customer questions and adjust wording where answers are unclear.
4. Remove duplicate or outdated documents that may conflict with newer content.
