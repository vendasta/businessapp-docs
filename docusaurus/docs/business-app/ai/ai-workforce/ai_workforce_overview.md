AI Employees are digital team members you can configure to automate conversations, answer customer questions, capture leads, book appointments, and more. Each works well out of the box but can be tailored to fit your business.

All AI Employees share a common structure: **name**, **purpose**, **channels**, **capabilities**, and **knowledge sources**. Specific roles (like Chat Receptionist or Voice Receptionist) may include additional options, but the basics are always the same.

**Guides:**

- [Set up the AI Voice Receptionist](ai-voice-receptionist.md)
- [AI Capabilities Overview](../ai-capabilities/)
- [Creating Custom Capabilities](../ai-capabilities/creating-custom-capabilities.md)

If you’re just getting started, the sections below give an overview of the main elements you’ll configure for any AI Employee.

## AI Employee Elements

### Profile

The **Profile** section is where you set the basics: how your AI Employee appears and how they introduce themselves to customers.

- **Name & Avatar** — The display name and image used across your channels. Choose a friendly, memorable name and a profile image (e.g. your logo or a custom avatar) that fits the role or your brand.
- **Purpose** — The job description and behavioral guidelines for your AI. Write a clear, short summary of what they should do—tone, greeting, and key tasks. Be specific.

:::tip
Use bullets or a numbered list to clarify instructions. For example: “Introduce yourself as the business receptionist,” “Speak in a friendly, concise way,” “Always collect name, email, and phone before ending the conversation.”

### Channels

The **Channels** section is where you choose where your AI Employee will work. Channels are the places your AI can interact with customers—website chat, SMS, email, phone calls, and more.

Turn on the channels that make sense for your business. You can enable or disable them at any time.

- Website chat
- Email
- SMS (text messages)
- Phone calls (voice)
- WhatsApp
- Facebook
- Instagram

:::tip
Start with one or two channels while you get comfortable, then expand as you see results.

### Capabilities

The **Capabilities** section is where you decide what your AI Employee can do. Capabilities are like skills or tasks you turn on or off—e.g. capturing leads, booking appointments, answering FAQs.

- **Turn on** the capabilities that matter most for your workflow.
- **Add or adjust** capabilities as your business needs change.
- **Create custom capabilities** for advanced or unique workflows. [Learn more ›](../ai-capabilities/creating-custom-capabilities.md)

Examples: capture lead information, book appointments with your calendar, answer common questions, follow your specific instructions or goals.

:::tip
You can experiment with different capabilities and update them any time as your business grows.

### Knowledge Sources

The **Knowledge Sources** section is where you give your AI information about your business so it can give accurate, up-to-date answers.

- **Connect your business profile** — Address, hours, services, contact info.
- **Add your website** — So the AI can answer questions about your offerings, prices, or policies.
- **Upload documents or custom text** — Menus, price lists, terms, or FAQs.
- **Review and update regularly** — Keep sources current so the AI never gives outdated info.

:::tip
The more up-to-date and specific your knowledge sources, the more helpful and accurate your AI Employee will be.

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary>What happens if I disable a capability?</summary>

The AI Employee will no longer perform that task. If a customer asks for it, the AI will say it can’t help with that request. The capability remains available so you can turn it back on later.
