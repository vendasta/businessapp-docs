Your AI Voice Receptionist helps answer your calls 24/7, captures new-lead info, gives callers fast and accurate answers, and helps get questions to the right person when they don't have an answer. 

**In this guide, you will learn:**
- What you need to get started with your AI Voice Receptionist
- How to configure basic settings
- How to test performance and troubleshoot
- Where to find answers to frequently asked questions or for deeper integration guides

## Why use an AI Voice Receptionist?

When a customer calls a business, they are usually a high-intent lead that wants to get an answer and get it fast. If a customer *doesn't* receive an answer, they will move on to calling the next business. 

Having an AI Voice Receptionist helps stop customers from moving on to the next business by at minimum answering their questions and potentially even booking an appointment. While some customers may prefer speaking to a human, being able to speak to someone representing the business is an improvement over not being able to answer the phone at all.

## Setting up the AI Voice Receptionist

### AI Voice Receptionist Call Flow & Routing

There are a number of ways to route calls to and from your Voice Receptionist to ensure that you never miss a lead.

![AI Voice Receptionist Call Flow](../img/ai-voice-receptionist-call-flow.png)

#### Routing phone calls to your AI Voice Receptionist

To have your Voice Receptionist handle calls for your business, you can:

1. **Direct calls to your Conversations number**  
Calls made directly to your Conversations phone number are sent to your AI Receptionist automatically.

2. **Forward calls from your business line to your Voice Receptionist**  
Customers can keep calling your existing business number and your telephone provider can then forward calls to your Conversations number. 

   Depending on your phone provider and telephone system your options to forward calls might include:
   - Forwarding all calls to your Conversations number
   - Forwarding calls to your Conversations number after a certain number of rings
   - Forwarding calls automatically after-hours

:::tip
For more help forwarding calls, see [Call Forwarding Setup in Conversations](../../conversations/conversations-setup-phone-calls.md).
:::

#### Handling calls from your AI Voice Receptionist

Once a call reaches your AI Voice Receptionist, there are a number of potential ways the call can be handled:

1. **AI Voice Receptionist answers calls**  
   The AI greets callers, answers FAQs using your knowledge base, captures contact details, and can book appointments.
  
2. **Forward calls**  
   The call is routed to another phone number automatically. See [Transfer calls to other numbers](#transfer-calls-to-other-numbers) to configure rules and destinations.
  
3. **End with a custom message**  
   A branded or informational message is played before the call is ended automatically.
  
4. **Missed-call SMS**  
   A text message is sent to callers, prompting them to leave a voicemail or schedule a callback.

:::note
While this guide will cover accessing these other options, it will focus on setting up the AI Voice Receptionist answer calls. For more detail on using the other options, see [Conversations Settings](../../administration/conversations-settings.md).

### Prerequisites for AI Voice Receptionist Setup

Before you get begin, make sure you've completed these prequisites so your AI Voice Receptionist setup goes smoothly.

| What you need                     | Where to find it              | Notes                                                |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| AI Voice Receptionist access      | <AISparkleIcon /> `AI` > `AI Workforce`             | See the [Conversations AI Overview](ai_workforce_overview.md) for edition and region availability.           |
| Conversations AI phone number        | <SettingsIcon /> `Adminsitration` > `Conversations Settings` | You will need this number for call-forwarding and publishing. This number is assigned after activating an eligible edition of Conversations AI.                |

### Step 1: Set up your AI Voice Receptionist Profile and Communication Channels
While your AI Voice Receptionist is capable of being a great representative for your business with very little configuration, there are a few things you can do to make them feel more on brand with your business and ensure they are set up correctly.

To get started, go to <AISparkleIcon /> `AI > AI Workforce` and click `Configure` on the Voice Receptionist. 

#### Set your AI Voice Receptionist's name and image

Give your AI Voice Receptionist a friendly, professional name and upload a photo or icon. Your Voice Receptionist will use this name when speaking to callers, and the photo helps you quickly identify it among your other AI Employees in the app. 

#### Set your AI Voice Receptionist's purpose

The Purpose section is where you define how your AI Voice Receptionist should behave and what it should prioritize. Include instructions about your business's voice, how the AI should greet callers, what information it should emphasize, and any important policies or procedures. This is where you make your AI Voice Receptionist uniquely suited to represent your business.

#### Choose your AI Voice Receptionist's voice

Under the `Profile` accordion, click on the `Speech` tab to reveal the dropdown for `Voice family` and `Voice`. Pick a voice family and voice that matches your brand. You can preview the different voices by selecting a `Voice` and clicking on the play arrow. 

:::tip Voice family and voice capabilities
Each voice family and voice have different strengths and weaknesses like response speed, expressiveness, and multi-lingual capabilities. While you will see a "Recommended" voice family and voice for your business, you can choose a different voice if you prefer!
:::

#### Choose your AI Voice Receptionist's communication channels
Under the `Channels` section, you will see all of the channels the AI Voice Receptionist can be assigned to work with. Your AI Voice Receptionist should be assigned to the Conversations AI phone number by default. 

### Step 2: Configure Your AI Voice Receptionist Capabilities

Your AI Voice Receptionist has a number of capabilities available by default that let them take calls like a human receptionist would. 

You can:
- Enable or disable these capabilities as needed
- Edit or configure the prompt for each capability
- Add new custom capabilities to expand their skills.

:::info Learn more about Capabilities
For more detailed information on Capabilities, see the [AI Workforce Overview](ai_workforce_overview.md#capabilities).
:::

#### Default voice lead capture for AI Voice Receptionist
The **default voice lead capture** capability guides your AI Employee to offer to help customers by answering questions and then gathering their contact information. This capability is turned on by default. 

> **Note:** It this is turned off, the Voice Receptionist will not be able to capture caller information but *will* still answer questions to the best of their ability.


#### Book appointments with your calendar

The **Book appointments with calendar** capability connects to your integrated calendar, enabling the AI Voice Receptionist to offer real-time availability to callers, collect all necessary booking details, and automatically create events on your calendar. 

On the `Book appointments with calendar` panel, use the `Select event link to book with` dropdown to choose which calendar your receptionst should use to determine availability as well as which kind of appointments they can offer.

#### Additional Instructions for AI Voice Receptionist

The **Additional Instructions** capability lets you give your AI Voice Receptionist custom guidance to shape its responses, tone, and logic. It sits at the top of the AI’s prompt stack to refine how it interacts with callers. 

To add additional instructions, click on the `Additional Instructions` tab in the Capabilities panel. From there you can write plain language instructions to your AI Voice Receptionist. 

Some examples of instructions you might want to add include:
- `Ask for the caller's address`
- `Do not promise a price`
- `If the caller asks to speak to a human, let them know you can't connect them with one today, but you can take a message and have them call back.`

#### Add a capability to your AI Voice Receptionist

You can extend your AI Voice Receptionist's capabilities by building your own custom capabilities. By adding your own "Tools" to custom capabilities, you can give your AI Voice Receptionist the ability to perform tasks that are specific to your business and build connections with other software you use.

:::info Learn more about custom capabilities
For more details on creating custom capabilities, see [Creating Custom Capabilities](../ai-capabilities/creating-custom-capabilities.md.md).
:::

#### Transfer calls to other numbers {#transfer-calls-to-other-numbers}

Enable your AI Voice Receptionist to live-transfer callers to one or more phone numbers based on caller intent and conditions you define. For example, route callers asking for "billing" to your billing department, send incoming calls to different teams based on the time of day, or transfer VIP clients directly to their account manager.

How to enable:
1. Go to `AI > AI Workforce > Voice Receptionist > Configure`
2. In Capabilities, click "Add new capability"
3. Select "Transfer call"
4. Add one or more destination numbers and define criteria (e.g., sales vs. support, business hours)

![Transfer Call capability](../img/voice-receptionist-transfer.png)

Best practices:
- Keep transfer criteria simple and unambiguous
- Specify after-hours behavior (e.g., transfer to after-hours line vs. take a message)

:::warning
Once a call is transferred, recording ends and the system does not record or transcribe the destination leg. If the destination doesn't answer, the transfer is not reverted; the caller would need to call again to speak with the AI.
:::

### Step 3: Add Knowledge Sources to your AI Voice Receptionist

The `Knowledge sources` panel lets you choose which information your AI Voice Receptionist can reference when answering calls. When your Voice Receptionist does not immediately have an answer to a caller's question, they will let the caller know they are taking a moment to look up information. If the Receptionist doesn't find the answer, they will let the caller know they don't have the information and offer to take a message and have someone call them back.

By default your Voice Receptionist has access to your:
- **Business Profile**:
Information shown in common business listings sites such as Services, Hours, and contact info. 
- **Website Homepage content**: 
Any relevant information available on your website's homepage that is written in text. 

If you need to add more detailed information for your AI Receptionist, you can use the `Add knowledge` bar to `+ Add new knowledge`. From here you can add text, website, or file information to your Knowledge Base and immediately have it available to your AI Voice Receptionist.

:::tip Learn more about Knowledge Sources
For more details on knowledge sources and adding them to the Knowledge Base, see the [Knowledge Base Overview](../knowledge-base.md).
