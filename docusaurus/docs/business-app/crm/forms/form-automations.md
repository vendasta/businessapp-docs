description: Create and manage form automations from the Automation tab—templates, follow-up email, and advanced workflows.
---

You can create and manage automations directly from a form using the `Automation` tab.

## Set up a form automation

1. Go to **CRM** > **Forms** and open an existing form (or create a new one).
2. Click the **Automation** tab in the form editor.
3. If no automation exists, choose a template (e.g. "Send follow-up email when a form is submitted") or start from Blank.
4. Configure the suggested step (for example, select a campaign for the follow-up email) and click **Save**.
5. Toggle the automation **On** using the switch in the top-right.

:::tip
Starting from a template is the fastest way to launch a reliable follow-up. You can always switch to **Advanced mode** to add steps later.

## Build more complex workflows

- Click **Advanced mode** to open the full automation builder.
- Add **Conditions** and additional **Actions** (for example, apply a tag, assign a task, send SMS).

:::note
The **Automation** tab shows all automations connected to the selected form.
