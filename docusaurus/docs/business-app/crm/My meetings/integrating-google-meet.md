## Overview

Calendar integration connects your Google Calendar to the platform, enabling automatic meeting scheduling, notetaker functionality, and seamless synchronization of your upcoming meetings.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up calendar integration, ensure you have:

- A Google Workspace or personal Google account
- Access to the My Meetings feature in your account

## Connecting your Google Calendar

1. Navigate to **My Meetings** from the main menu.
2. Click on **Meeting Settings**.
3. Select **Connect Calendar**.
4. Sign in with your Google account and grant the required permissions.
5. Once connected, your upcoming calendar events will automatically sync.

**Demo:**

<div style={{position: "relative", paddingBottom: "56.25%", height: 0}}>
  <iframe 
    src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cgcuBW4zyQ1AzlkJXqf-9RsDWfO8JIU8/view?usp=drive_link" 
    frameBorder="0" 
    webkitallowfullscreen="true" 
    mozallowfullscreen="true" 
    allowFullScreen 
    style={{position: "absolute", top: 0, left: 0, width: "100%", height: "100%"}}>
  </iframe>
</div>

## What happens after connection

Once your calendar is connected:

- **Automatic sync**: Your upcoming meetings appear in the My Meetings > Upcoming meetings tab
- **Notetaker scheduling**: The platform automatically schedules notetakers for your meetings
- **Meeting insights**: AI-powered summaries and transcripts are generated for recorded meetings

### Disconnecting your calendar
