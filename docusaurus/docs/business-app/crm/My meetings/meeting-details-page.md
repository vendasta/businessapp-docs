## Sharing meeting details (Internal share only)

To share a meeting with others:

1. Select **Share** on the Meeting Details page.
2. Choose a visibility option:
   - Private: These meeting recordings are visible to you and other internal participants of your company. These meeting recordings are not logged in the CRM.
   - All of your company: These meeting recordings are visible to you and other internal participants of your company. These meeting recordings are logged in the CRM.
   - Anyone with the link: These meeting recordings are visible to anyone with the link internally within your company. These meeting recordings are not logged in the CRM.
3. Copy the generated link.
4. Optionally, set a custom start time to direct viewers to a specific point in the meeting. This is useful if you want to share a specific section of the meeting.

Sharing meeting details helps keep everyone aligned without scheduling additional meetings.

## Best practices

  Early review helps capture important details while they are still fresh.

- **Follow up on action items**  
  Use the Action Items list to assign tasks in your CRM or project management tools.

- **Track recurring patterns**  
  Look across multiple meetings for trends in clarity scores, highlights, or lowlights.

- **Share selectively**  
  Choose appropriate visibility settings to protect sensitive information.

By using the Meeting Details page effectively, you can turn recorded meetings into actionable insights and improve future conversations.

## Frequently asked questions

### Interaction metrics

<details>
  <summary><strong>How is talk time measured?</strong></summary>

  **What it is**  
  Talk time is the percentage of the call spent speaking by each person.

  **Example**  
  In a landscaping discovery call, if the rep talks 80% of the time about their equipment, they are not listening to the customer's vision for their yard.

  **Scoring specs**  
  Talk time is scored on a scale from 0 to 100. The total talk time across all participants always adds up to 100.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>What is the question rate?</strong></summary>

  **What it is**  
  The question rate is the average number of questions the rep asks per hour of conversation.

  **Example**  
  A private tutor asking, "What subjects are hardest?" and "How do they feel about tests?" demonstrates a high level of curiosity.

  **Scoring specs**  
  The score is a number representing questions per hour and is capped at 10.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>How is the patience score determined?</strong></summary>

  **What it is**  
  The patience score measures the average length of the pause the rep takes after the guest finishes speaking before responding.

  **Example**  
  When a bakery client says, "I'm worried about the price," a high-scoring rep waits a moment, giving the client space to finish their thought.

  **Scoring specs**  
  The score is calculated as the average of transition pause values in seconds and is capped at 10.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>What is the interruption score?</strong></summary>

  **What it is**  
  The interruption score counts how many times the host cuts off the guest mid-sentence.

  **Example**  
  A real estate agent who stops a seller mid-sentence to talk about their own commission would score poorly.

  **Scoring specs**  
  The score ranges from 0 to 100. A score of 100 means interrupting everything the guest says, while 0 means never interrupting.

</details>

### Clarity and communication

<details>
  <summary><strong>How is language simplicity scored?</strong></summary>

  **What it is**  
  Language simplicity measures how well the rep avoids complex jargon in favor of plain English.

  **Example**  
  An IT consultant saying, "We keep your files unhackable" scores higher than saying, "We use 256-bit AES encryption."

  **Scoring specs**  
  This metric is scored on a scale of 1 to 5 based on the presence of industry-specific jargon.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>How is active listening measured?</strong></summary>

  **What it is**  
  Active listening looks for evidence that the rep heard and processed what the guest said, often by repeating or summarizing it.

  **Example**  
  "So, what I'm hearing is that you need the new HVAC unit installed before the weekend heatwave—is that right?"

  **Scoring specs**  
  The score ranges from 1 to 5 based on semantic acknowledgment of guest inputs.

</details>

### RAVEN framework

<details>
  <summary><strong>What is assessment and discovery?</strong></summary>

  **What it is**  
  Assessment and discovery evaluate the rep's ability to dig deep and identify the root cause of the customer's problem.

  **Example**  
  A gym owner asking, "What has prevented you from staying consistent with your workouts in the past?"

  **Scoring specs**  
  This metric is scored on a scale of 1 to 5 based on the quality and depth of needs-analysis questions.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>How are next steps and ownership evaluated?</strong></summary>

  **What it is**  
  This measures how clearly the rep defines what happens after the call ends.

  **Example**  
  Instead of saying, "I'll be in touch," the rep says, "I'll send the quote by 3 PM today and call you at 10 AM Friday."

  **Scoring specs**  
  The score ranges from 1 to 5 based on clarity of action items, deadlines, and assigned owners.

</details>

### Sales methodologies

<details>
  <summary><strong>How are sales methodologies scored?</strong></summary>

  **What it is**  
  This metric measures how closely the rep follows a specific, established sales framework such as BANT or SPIN during the call.

  **Example**  
  For BANT, a roofing contractor confirms budget and timeline. For SPIN, an accountant asks about the implications of an IRS audit.

  **Scoring specs**  
  Each methodology is scored on a range from 1 to 10. The AI scans the transcript for keywords and concepts related to each framework.
