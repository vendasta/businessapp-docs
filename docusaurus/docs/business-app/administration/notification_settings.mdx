Notification settings in **Business App** let you control how you receive alerts across products. You can choose which events trigger an email, whether notifications arrive instantly or as part of a daily digest, and the default behavior for each notification type.

Notifications are organized by product. Each section lets you review **Instant Email Notifications** and **Daily Digest Emails** for that product. You can manage your preferences in **Settings → Notification Settings** in Business App.

## Global settings

At the top of the Notification Settings page, you can configure global defaults that apply to all products unless you override them for a specific product.

- **Instant email and In-App (when available)** — Controls whether real-time notifications are sent via email and appear in-app.
- **Daily Digest** — Controls whether daily summary emails are sent.

Each dropdown offers:

- **Default (Enabled)** — Uses the system default (usually enabled).
- **Enabled** — Always sends this notification type.
- **Disabled** — Turns off this notification type completely.

## Types of notifications

### Instant email notifications

Instant emails are sent in real time when specific events occur — such as new leads, reviews, or post approvals. They help you stay on top of key activity without waiting for daily summaries.

### Daily digest emails

Digest emails combine multiple events into a single summary message sent once per day. They are ideal if you prefer fewer emails while still staying informed about business activity.

## Manage notification settings

To view or adjust your notifications:

1. In **Business App**, go to **Settings → Notification Settings**.
2. Expand each product (e.g., Business App, Reputation AI, Social Marketing, WordPress Hosting).
3. Use the dropdown beside each item to toggle between:
   - **Enabled (Default)** — the notification is turned on by default.
   - **Disabled (Default)** — the notification is turned off by default.
4. Click **Save** to apply changes.
