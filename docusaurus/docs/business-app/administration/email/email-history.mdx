# Email history

Email history is a log of messages Business App sends and receives for your account. Use it to confirm delivery, see why a notification didn’t arrive, or export records for your own records.

You can review outbound and inbound emails from your account and connected products. Filter by status, date, recipient, and subject to troubleshoot deliverability or check that automations sent the right messages.

## Access email history

1. Sign in to **Business App**.
2. Go to **Settings → Conversations → Email history**.
3. Use the search, date, and status filters to narrow the list.

## Review message details

- **Delivery status** — Whether the email was sent, bounced, deferred, or marked as spam.
- **Channel source** — Which product, workflow, or user triggered the message.
- **Preview** — Open the original content to confirm dynamic fields and branding.

## Export records

- Select individual messages or **Select all** to export the full result set.
- Click **Export** to download a CSV with timestamps, recipients, and delivery metadata.

## Troubleshooting tips

- Filter by **Bounced** or **Deferred** to find problem recipients quickly.
- Cross-check with [Email Configuration](./email-configuration) to ensure SPF, DKIM, and DMARC are still verified.
- If an expected email didn’t send, check [Notification Settings](../notification_settings.mdx) and any related automations.
