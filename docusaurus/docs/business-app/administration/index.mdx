## What can you manage in the Administration section?

The **Administration** section provides access to system-wide configuration tools all in one place. Your dashboard relies on key configurations that determine how leads are captured, communications are handled, and automations are triggered. Everything in Administration works together to ensure that:
- Your tools are connected and synced correctly
- AI and messaging features are properly configured
- Workflows and communication channels are set up in a way that streamlines your operations for your needs

Keeping these foundational settings aligned improves daily operations and makes your system easier to manage over time.
