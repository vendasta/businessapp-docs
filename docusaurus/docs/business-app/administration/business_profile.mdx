## What is my Business Profile?
Your **Business Profile** allows you to manage your core business information in one central place. This includes your name, location, website, branding, services, social profiles, and operational details.

This profile ensures that your business information is accurate and consistent across listings, reports, lead capture tools, and across all features of your app.

## Why is my Business Profile Important?
Keeping your Business Profile complete and up to date helps your business:
- Appear accurately in local search and online listings
- Build trust with customers through consistent branding and clear service offerings
- Power tools like lead capture tools, automations, and inbox messaging with the correct business details

## Access the Business Profile

You can open this page by going to **My Business > Business Profile.**

## Keep profile data in sync

Your Business Profile is used by other products in the app when they are active on your account (such as Local SEO or Reputation AI). Editing your profile here updates it everywhere, so you only need to maintain it in one place.

## Primary Info
In the **Primary Info** tab, you can update:

- **Business name** and **common name**
- **Website URL**
- **Primary business category** and additional categories
- **Physical address** with map marker
- **Phone number** (must be formatted internationally)
- **Service area business** toggle

Click `Save` to apply your updates.

These details power your listings. 

## Hours
In the **Hours** tab, you can update:

- **Hours of operation**
- Special hours (like holidays)

## Descriptions
In the **Descriptions** tab, you can add a:

- **Short description** (up to 200 characters)  
  Appears in previews and listings  
- **Long description** (up to 750 characters)  
  Describes your business in more detail  

You can also use the `Suggest Description` button to generate content with the help of AI. Click `Save` to apply your updates.

You can search or scroll through the dropdown to add applicable options for each platform. Once selected, they will be synced to the appropriate listings platform when supported. Click `Save` to apply your updates.
