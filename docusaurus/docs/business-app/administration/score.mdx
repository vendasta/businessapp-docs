# Score

**Score** in Business App covers two areas: **grades in your Executive Report** (e.g. Review Grade, Listing Score) and **scoring in your CRM** (contact/lead scores). Together they help you see how your business is performing and which contacts or leads to focus on.

## What scores you'll see

### In the Executive Report

Your Executive Report can include scores such as:

- **Review Grade** — A letter grade (A–F) that summarises your online review presence and how it compares to others in your industry. It's based on your average review score, number of review sources, reviews found, and reviews per month.
- **Listing Score** — How accurate and complete your business listings are across the web.
- **Listing Precision** — How strict or relaxed that listing accuracy is measured (this is set by your provider).

These scores help you track performance at a glance and spot areas to improve.

### In the CRM

- **Contact Score (Lead Score)** — A numeric score you can assign to each contact based on their activity or value to your business. It appears on the contact's profile and can be updated manually or through integrations. Use it to prioritise follow-ups, segment contacts, and trigger automations.
- **Lead or fit scoring** — If your account has additional lead or fit scoring enabled, you may also see scores on contacts and companies that help you prioritise who to contact first.

## Contact Score (Lead Score)

Contact Scoring lets you assign a numeric score to each contact so you can track engagement, prioritise follow-ups, and segment contacts for marketing and service efforts. It's useful for identifying high-priority contacts, monitoring lead quality, and tailoring communications. The score appears directly on each contact's profile.

### Why use Contact Scoring?

Not all contacts are equally engaged or valuable. Contact Scoring helps you:

- Qualify leads based on behaviour or attributes
- Identify high-priority contacts at a glance
- Inform automated workflows or segmentation

### How to view and update a Contact Score

1. Go to **Administration**.
2. Select **App Settings**, then click **Score**.
3. On the scoring page, you can view or update contact scores.
4. Enter a new numeric score and click **Save**.

Anyone with permission to manage contact records can edit the score.

### How to use Contact Scores in the CRM

1. In your CRM, open **Contacts** and use **Add Filter**.
2. Choose **Lead Score** in the dropdown to filter by score.

You can use contact scores to:

- **Segment contacts** for targeted messaging (e.g. top scorers receive a referral offer)
- **Prioritise follow-ups** by sorting or filtering contacts by score
- **Track engagement trends** over time for each contact

## Understanding your Review Grade

The **Review Grade** is calculated from four areas: average review score, number of review sources, reviews found, and reviews per month. Each is compared to the industry average and combined into one letter grade:

- **A** = 90th–100th percentile
- **B** = 75th–89th percentile
- **C** = 50th–74th percentile
- **D** = 30th–49th percentile
- **F** = 0th–29th percentile

For more detail and how to improve your grade, see the Reputation section of the Executive Report.

- [Reputation and Review Grade](../executivereport/reputation) — How the Review Grade is calculated and what it means for your business.

## How scores are used

- **Executive Report** — Review Grade and Listing Score give you a clear view of reputation and listing health. Use them to set goals and track progress over time.
- **CRM** — Use contact and lead scores to prioritise contacts and companies, align follow-up with pipeline stages, and trigger automations (e.g. when a score reaches a threshold).
- **Conversations** — Your grades in the report can guide discussions about where to focus (e.g. getting more reviews or improving listing accuracy).

## Tips

- **Check your scores regularly** so you know where you stand and can work on areas that need improvement.
- **Understand what affects your grade** — For Review Grade, things like review volume, star rating, and number of sources all matter. For Listing Score, completeness and accuracy of your business info matter.
- **Use the Executive Report** — If you don't see a score or section, your provider may have customised which parts of the report are visible for your account.
- **Define a scoring range** for contact scores (e.g. 1–10 or 0–100) and use it consistently so filtering and automations stay meaningful.
