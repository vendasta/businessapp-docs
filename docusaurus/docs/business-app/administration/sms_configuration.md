## SMS Registration and Setup (US Businesses Only)

To prevent spam and ensure reliable delivery, phone carriers in the United States require businesses to register their phone numbers before sending SMS messages to customers (A2P 10DLC). 

:::warning
Registration time can vary significantly from hours to weeks depending on various external factors. You should start the registration process early if you have a deadline for when you want to start using SMS.

To register a US-based business:

1. Go to `Administration > Conversations Settings > Phone & SMS` to see the registration card
2. Click "Register now" to view the form
3. Fill out the form completely with your business information
4. Submit your EIN (Employer Identification Number)
5. Click "Submit information"

You can save your progress if you're unsure of some fields and return to complete the registration later.

Your business will need an EIN number - a nine-digit number the IRS uses to identify your business for tax purposes. If you don't know your EIN, you can apply for one by submitting IRS Form SS-4 online.

## Configuration Steps
1. Go to Administration > Conversations Settings > Phone & SMS.
2. Complete the registration process above if you're a US-based business.
3. Select your sending number.
4. Add opt-out language to automated messages.
