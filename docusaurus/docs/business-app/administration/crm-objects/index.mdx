# CRM objects and fields

CRM objects house the contacts, companies, and opportunities that power reporting, automations, and conversations in Business App. CRM Fields let you add custom data fields to your contact and company records.

## What are CRM Fields?

CRM Fields let you add custom data fields to your contact and company records. These fields can store information that isn't in the default setup—such as birthdays, service preferences, or internal notes. You can create and organize fields based on your business needs.

This feature helps you go beyond standard fields like phone number or address and keep important contact and company details in one place, without separate spreadsheets or systems.

## Why are CRM Fields important?

Default contact and company records often don't include everything your business needs to track. You might want to log whether someone has set an appointment, track preferences, or store internal status flags. Custom fields let you tailor the system so it works for **your business**, keeping important information accessible and organized.

## What's included with CRM Objects and Fields?

- Standard CRM objects: **Contacts**, **Companies**, and **Opportunities**
- Custom field creation for **Contacts** and **Companies**
- Multiple field types: Text, Number, Email, Phone number, Date, Boolean, and more
- Searchable and editable fields in the Contacts and Companies sections
- Full visibility and editing from the CRM fields manager

:::info
System fields (like company name or phone number) cannot be edited or deleted. Custom fields are fully configurable.

## Core CRM objects

- **Contacts** — Individual people you communicate with. Support phone, email, SMS, tasks, and marketing lists.
- **Companies** — Businesses, locations, or accounts that own contacts and opportunities.
- **Opportunities** — Pipeline stages for tracking sales deals or projects.

### Create custom objects

Beyond Contacts, Companies, and Opportunities, you can create custom object types that fit your business (e.g. service contracts, equipment assets, project milestones). To create a custom object:

1. Go to **Administration → CRM Objects**
2. Click **Create Custom Object**
3. Configure the singular and plural names and default fields

For more on extending records with custom fields, see [CRM Fields](./app_settings_crm_fields.md).

## Field types and options

When creating a custom field, you can choose from:

- **Decimal number** — Decimal values (e.g., review score)
- **Email** — Validated email
- **Phone number** — Formatted phone number
- **Date** — Calendar date (e.g., birthday)
- **Date and time** — Date and time (e.g., next meeting)
- **True or false** — Boolean yes/no

Use **String List** when you want multiple values in a single field (e.g., preferred services).

## Managing and editing CRM fields

- All fields appear in the CRM fields manager under **Contacts** or **Companies**.
- Click any field name to open and edit it.
- You can update the description or field type; object and identifier may be locked after creation.
