## Understand the Business App data model

CRM Objects are the building blocks of your customer data. Every contact, company, and opportunity in Business App is stored as an object. Administration controls in this section help you tailor those objects so the CRM mirrors how your business actually operates.

Use this space when you want to:

- Add or edit **custom fields** so records include the exact details your team needs
- Review the default system fields that power search, filters, and automations
- Plan how information flows between Contacts, Companies, Opportunities, and Activities

Keeping your objects organized makes every downstream workflow—Conversations, Automations, reporting, AI workflows, and integrations—much more reliable.

## Core CRM objects

- **Contacts** – Individual people you communicate with. Support phone, email, SMS, tasks, and marketing lists.
- **Companies** – Businesses, locations, or accounts that own contacts and opportunities.
- **Opportunities** – Optional pipeline stages for tracking sales deals or projects.

## Extend objects with custom fields

Need to store more than the default set of fields? Use [CRM Fields](./app_settings_crm_fields.md) to introduce additional data points such as preferred services, contract numbers, or onboarding dates.

Custom fields allow you to:

- Build richer filters and segments for messaging and automations.
- Power AI workflows by supplying structured context about your customers.
- Keep internal team notes centralized instead of scattered across spreadsheets.

:::tip Keep fields purposeful
Before adding a new field, confirm when it will be captured, who will update it, and how it should be used in reports or workflows. Consistent data entry keeps automations accurate.
