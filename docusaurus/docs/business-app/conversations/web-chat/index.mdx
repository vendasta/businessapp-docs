# Web Chat Setup & Usage

The AI web chat widget automatically captures leads from your website and answers visitor questions 24/7. Here's how to set it up and use it effectively.

## Prerequisites

- **Product Required**: Conversations AI Standard, Pro or Premium subscription
- **Access**: Business App with Conversations enabled
- **Website**: Any website where you can add HTML code

## Setup Process

### Step 1: Test Before Installing

1. Navigate to **Business App > Conversations AI > Conversations AI Settings**
2. Click **"Try it out today"** on the Web Chat Widget card
3. This creates a demo widget on the My Listing page for testing
4. Reload the Conversations AI Settings page to see configuration options

### Step 2: Configure Web Chat Settings

1. Click **"Configure Web Chat"** in Conversations AI Settings
2. **Widget Name**: Enter a unique name to identify this widget (usually your domain)

### Step 3: Set Up AI Assistant

1. Go to **AI Assistant** settings card to train and customize:
   - **Select an AI Assistant**: Choose a pre-built AI Assistant (like Chat Receptionist)
   - Add business knowledge: Click "Add knowledge" → Select "Website" to scrape your website content
   - Add custom Q&A: Manually enter frequently asked questions and answers
   - Set business profile info: Ensure location, services, and hours are correct

### Step 4: Customize Messages

Configure how visitors interact with the widget:

- **Welcome Greeting** (0-70 characters): Appears in chat widget header to encourage engagement
  - Example: "Hi, how can we help you today?"
- **Initial AI Message** (up to 600 characters): First message your AI assistant sends. This is automatically turned on and includes a default message along with privacy notice. This can be changed to any message you prefer.
  - Example: "Hi! I'm here to assist with your [service] questions. How can I help you today?"
  - Keep it friendly, specific to your business, and encourage engagement
  - To add a link to the message, use this format: `[Link text Here](https://www.example.com)`

### Step 5: Customize Appearance

Match the widget to your brand:

- **Primary Color**: Main widget color (header, branding)
- **Primary Text Color**: Text color for primary elements
- **Accent Color**: Send button and chat bubble color  
- **Accent Text Color**: Text color for accent elements
- **Position**: Choose bottom corner position (left/right)

**Test Installation**: Always verify the widget appears and functions correctly on the live site

## Widget Types and Widget Actions

### Floating Chat Widget
This is the default method of adding the AI Receptionist to your website. It places a floating button on the bottom left or right corner of your website that allows users to start chatting with the AI Assistant.

### Embedded Chat Widget
This is a more advanced version of the chat widget that places a chat box anywhere you want on your website. To make this work, you will need to add a placeholder space on your website (a container) and load the embedded chat widget code into that space. 

- The code can be copied from the web chat configuration page
- Make sure to give your container enough height to properly display the chat (eg. 400-600)
- Test on both desktop and mobile

### Widget Actions
When a chat widget is loaded onto a website, you can add widget actions—links that will populate the chat with a message on behalf of your user. These are great when you want to help your users engage with your AI Receptionist in a specific way. For example, clicking a button that pre-fills "I want to book an appointment" so your AI Receptionist can start guiding a user along that particular workflow.

Under the widget actions section of web chat configuration, you will find the types of actions, implementation options, and instructions for using the code that is generated based on your selections which you can then copy and add to your site. Here is a breakdown of the configuration options:

#### Select an Action
1. **Prefill message** - Use this option if you want to suggest a message but don't want to force your users to send it.
2. **Send message** - Use this option if you want the message sent to the AI assistant; useful for initiating specific workflows.

#### Select an Implementation Method
1. **Anchor link listener** - Triggers the action via a URL. Best for direct links, email campaigns, or navigating to a page with the web chat from an external source.
2. **JavaScript API** - Triggers the action programmatically. Best for dynamic interactions, custom triggers, or on-page buttons.

#### Enter a Message
Enter a message that will be used in selected action when the link is clicked. If left empty, the action will open the Web Chat only.

#### Code
The code changes depending on the action, implementation, and message set. You can configure these multiple times to create multiple snippets of code and have many different actions. Instructions for using the code vary depending on implementation method.
1. **For anchor link listener:** Use the code in a URL as an anchor link or redirect target. The widget will automatically detect the hash and trigger the action when the page loads or when the hash changes.
2. **For JavaScript API:** Use the code in your button's onClick handler or any JavaScript event. The webchatAPI is automatically available once the widget script loads.

## Managing Conversations

### When AI Assistant Hands Off to Humans

- AI assistant captures lead information first (name, phone/email)
- Team members get notified of new conversations
- Staff can join conversations through Business App > Conversations
- Chat history remains available for context

### Lead Follow-Up

- New leads automatically appear in your CRM
- Follow up via SMS (US/Canada) or email 
- Use automations to send immediate responses
- Set up nurture campaigns for qualified leads

## How Will I Be Notified About a New Lead?

When your AI assistant successfully captures a name and contact info, a few things will happen automatically:

1. A new contact is added to your CRM Contacts, with the captured info: First name, last name, phone number, and email address.
   * If a lead updates their contact info in the AI-assisted web chat (like for example, if they make a mistake), the latest contact info will be updated on the contact automatically.
2. A "New lead" email notification is sent to users on your account. Make sure you have notifications enabled for new leads.

## Common Issues & Solutions

<details>
<summary><strong>Widget Not Appearing</strong></summary>

If the Conversations web chat widget does not appear on your site after installation, try these troubleshooting steps:

#### 1. Clear your browser cache

- **Browser cache:** Force your browser to load the newest version of your site.
  - Mac: `Shift` + `Command` + `R`
  - PC: `Ctrl` + `F5`
- **Website hosting cache:** Clear your website's cache (e.g., use the "Flush Cache" button if available in your website platform).
- **WordPress/Divi cache:** If using the Divi theme, go to Theme Options > Builder > Advanced and disable "Static CSS File Generation."
- **Other cache plugins:** Temporarily disable any cache plugins and refresh your site.

#### 2. Check your widget code placement

Ensure the widget installation code is pasted in the correct location:
- The code must be inside the `<head>` section of your site's HTML (not the `<body>` or a widget block).
- For WordPress, double-check if the plugin is active, or if you pasted the code into the correct theme section.

#### 3. Check your hosting platform for plugin or theme conflicts

- Disable other plugins or custom code temporarily to see if something is blocking the widget.
- If you find a conflict, try re-enabling plugins one by one to isolate the issue.

#### 4. Verify activation

- Confirm Conversations AI Pro is active on your account, and the web chat widget is enabled.

## Additional FAQs

<details>
<summary><strong>Can the AI assistant scrape websites for information?</strong></summary>

Yes, the AI can be trained on website content to enhance its knowledge base.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I upload files like PDFs or DOCs for the AI to learn from?</strong></summary>

Currently, only raw text can be added to the AI's knowledge base.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why is the AI responding with incorrect or incomplete information?</strong></summary>

The information the AI responds to inquiries with is based on the source information it has only. The web chat tool shows you directly inside the Conversations chat record where it got the source information from, like a quick audit. You can then make the change on your website or inside your AI knowledge base. The most common culprit is old or incorrect information found on the website.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How long does training the AI take?</strong></summary>

Training duration varies based on website size but typically takes between 1-5 minutes.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is there a limit to the number of AI responses?</strong></summary>

No, unlimited AI responses are included with Conversations Pro.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What languages does the AI support?</strong></summary>

The AI assistant can respond in over 40 languages, including English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Turkish, Polish, Ukrainian, Russian, Japanese, and Chinese.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why won't the chat widget let me type certain letters or the "Space" key when trying to type?</strong></summary>

Some plugins can interfere with the ability to type in the widget because they "hijack" that key for their own functions.

For example, website admins will have trouble typing messages into the web chat widget when the WordPress Jetpack plugin is enabled because it hijacks some of the keys to open and close their own chat functions. Disabling the JetPack plugin will restore the function of these keys.

Smooth scrolling website features can also interfere with the ability of your website visitors to type the 'space' key with the web chat widget. If you have the Divi theme on a WordPress website, you can disable smooth scrolling by going to Divi > Theme Options and disabling the Smooth Scrolling functions.

<details>
<summary><strong>How do I remove the Google reCAPTCHA badge that's blocking my chat widget?</strong></summary>

When reCAPTCHA is being used on a website form, this badge will appear in the bottom right of a webpage – which could be in the way of the web chat widget.

You can hide the badge completely on your website with some custom CSS; just make sure to follow Google's required alternative ways to inform the user that reCAPTCHA is being used.
