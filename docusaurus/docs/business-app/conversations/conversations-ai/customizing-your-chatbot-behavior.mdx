# Customizing Your Chatbot's Behavior

With the AI Assistant in Web Chat, you can customize how it interacts with users to suit your brand and customer needs. Use the Additional Instructions feature to define specific behaviors, conversation flows, and personality traits.

## Accessing Chatbot Settings

To customize your chatbot's behavior:

1. Navigate to **Conversations AI Settings** > **Web Chat Configuration** > **AI Assistant**.
2. Locate the **Additional Instructions** field.

This is where you'll add custom instructions to control how your AI Assistant behaves and interacts with visitors.

## Customization Options

You can customize several aspects of your chatbot's behavior using Additional Instructions:

### AI Tone and Personality

Adjust the chatbot's tone and personality to align with your brand's voice and values. For example:
- Professional and formal
- Friendly and casual
- Technical and detailed
- Conversational and approachable

### Conversation Flow and Link Redirection

Define when the AI Assistant should share specific links, such as:
- Booking links for appointments or consultations
- Support documentation or help articles
- Product pages or service information
- Contact forms or other conversion tools

### Qualifying Questions

Add targeted questions to better qualify leads, such as:
- Service area or location requirements
- Project details or specific needs
- Budget or timeline information
- Preferred contact method

### Contact Information Collection

Specify how the AI gathers contact details:
- Choose to ask for a phone number, email address, or both
- Customize the order in which these fields are requested
- Set requirements for which fields are mandatory

The AI can collect the following contact details:
- **First Name, Last Name**
- **Phone Number, Email Address**
- **Address, City, State/Province, Zip/Postal Code, Country**

### Localization Preferences

Adapt language preferences to match your audience, such as:
- British English vs. American English
- Regional terminology and expressions
- Cultural communication styles

## Best Practices

When writing Additional Instructions:

- **Be specific**: Clear, detailed instructions produce better results than vague guidance
- **Use examples**: Include example responses or conversation flows when helpful
- **Test and iterate**: Start with basic instructions and refine based on actual conversations
- **Stay on brand**: Ensure your instructions align with your brand voice and values
- **Keep it focused**: Too many instructions can confuse the AI—focus on what matters most

## Next Steps

After customizing your chatbot's behavior:

1. Test your changes by starting a conversation with your web chat widget
2. Review conversation transcripts to see how the AI is responding
3. Refine your instructions based on real interactions
4. Monitor lead quality and conversion rates to measure effectiveness

Personalize the chatbot to create a seamless experience for your customers while maintaining alignment with your brand. These customizations help ensure the AI Assistant meets your unique business needs.
