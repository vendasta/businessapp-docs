# Conversations AI

Conversations AI adds AI receptionist functionality to your Conversations platform. The AI assistant can handle incoming communications across multiple channels when you or your team are unavailable.

## What Conversations AI Unlocks

Conversations AI gives you access to three powerful AI components:

- **AI Receptionist** - Automated assistant that handles calls, messages, and web chat across all channels. See [AI Workforce Overview](../../ai/ai-workforce/) for setup and capabilities.

- **AI Capabilities** - Custom behaviors and actions the AI can perform, like booking appointments or checking inventory. Learn more in [AI Capabilities](../../ai/ai-capabilities/).

- **Knowledge Base** - Business information and content the AI references to provide accurate answers. Configure sources in [Knowledge Base](../../ai/knowledge-base).

Together, these components create an intelligent receptionist that knows your business and can take meaningful action on your behalf.
