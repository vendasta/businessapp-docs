Conversations allows you to send and receive emails with leads and customers via Conversations from a shared email address.

When you get a new lead from web chat or a form, and that lead provides an email address as a way to contact them, anyone on your team can reply via email to that customer from your centralized Conversations, without needing to open a separate email client.

### **Features**

- Available to all users of Conversations AI, both Conversations AI Standard and Conversations AI Pro
- Send emails to contacts using your assigned email address
- Receive email replies back into a team-shared Conversations, where anyone on your team can continue the conversation
- Setup email forwarding to receive emails sent to your business-owned email address in Conversations
- AI auto-response support for instant 24/7 customer support via email

## AI Auto-Response for Emails

The AI Chat Receptionist can automatically respond to inbound emails, providing instant 24/7 customer support via email just like other communication channels. When enabled, the AI will:

- Automatically reply to customer emails within minutes
- Answer questions using your business profile and knowledge base
- Capture lead information and book appointments
- Create a conversation thread in Conversations for your team to monitor

**To enable AI auto-response for email:**

## How Email Works in Conversations

### Email Sender Address

Conversations uses a shared email address to keep all customer conversations in one place. When you send a message, it appears to come from your business's assigned email (like `reply+xxxxx@businessapp.io`), but the sender's name and signature are visible to the customer. This helps your team collaborate without confusion over who sent what.

### Email Reply-to Routing

The reply-to feature ensures that responses from customers are automatically directed back to the shared Conversations thread. When a customer replies, their response lands in the same conversation where any team member can continue the discussion.

## Receiving Email Replies

- Customer replies automatically route back to your shared Conversations
- The "reply-to" is set to your `reply+xxxxx@businessapp.io`, so all responses land in the same thread
- Any team member can view and respond to email conversations from the shared workspace

### **Forward emails into Conversations from other email addresses**

By setting up email forwarding, you can receive emails from leads and customers sent to an email address your business owns into the centralized Conversations, so your team can collaborate on replying.

For example, you might use a general business email address for customer inquiries, like team@yourcompany.com. With forwarding, any time someone sends an email to that address, it will also appear in Conversations.

**How to set up forwarding from Gmail:**

1. In gmail.com, go to Settings > See all settings.
2. Select [Forwarding and POP/IMAP](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/fwdandpop) tab
3. Click "Add a forwarding address" and paste in your unique email address from Conversations Settings, click Next, sign in again if required, and confirm.
4. In Conversations, you will receive a confirmation message. Click the link to confirm the request to forward email.
5. After confirming, you will need to return to Gmail Forwarding settings one more time, to ENABLE forwarding, then save your changes. You can also optionally use filtering to forward only some of the messages.

**How to set up forwarding from Outlook:**

1. In outlook.com, select Settings
2. Select Mail > [Forwarding](https://outlook.live.com/mail/options/mail/forwarding).
3. To turn on forwarding, select Enable forwarding, enter the forwarding email address, and select Save.
