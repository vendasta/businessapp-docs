Conversations allows you to send and receive emails with leads and customers via Conversations from a shared email address.

When you get a new lead from web chat or a form, and that lead provides an email address as a way to contact them, anyone on your team can reply via email to that customer from your centralized Conversations, without needing to open a separate email client.

### **Features**

- Available to all users of Conversations AI, both Conversations AI Standard and Conversations AI Pro
- Send emails to contacts using your assigned email address.
- Receive email replies back into a team-shared Conversations, where anyone on your team can continue the conversation.
- Setup email forwarding to receive emails sent to your business-owned email address in Conversations

### **How to send a new message**

- To send an email to a new or existing contact, click the 'new message' button in Conversations and enter the email address of the person you'd like to send a message to.
- When the customer replies to a sent email, their reply-to is automatically set to your assigned Conversations email address, and replies will appear in Conversations in the same conversation.

### **Forward emails into Conversations from other email addresses**

By setting up email forwarding, you can receive emails from leads and customers sent to an email address your business owns into the centralized Conversations, so your team can collaborate on replying.

For example, you might use a general business email address for customer inquiries, like team@yourcompany.com. With forwarding, any time someone sends an email to that address, it will also appear in Conversations.

**How to set up forwarding from Gmail:**

1. In gmail.com, go to Settings > See all settings.
2. Select [Forwarding and POP/IMAP](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/fwdandpop) tab
3. Click "Add a forwarding address" and paste in your unique email address from Conversations Settings, click Next, sign in again if required, and confirm.
4. In Conversations, you will receive a confirmation message. Click the link to confirm the request to forward email.
5. After confirming, you will need to return to Gmail Forwarding settings one more time, to ENABLE forwarding, then save your changes. You can also optionally use filtering to forward only some of the messages.

**How to set up forwarding from Outlook:**

1. In outlook.com, select Settings
2. Select Mail > [Forwarding](https://outlook.live.com/mail/options/mail/forwarding).
3. To turn on forwarding, select Enable forwarding, enter the forwarding email address, and select Save.
