### Customize Notifications

You can customize your notification settings so you receive alerts for new messages and leads in Conversations.

- Click on <NotificationsIcon /> `Notifications` in the top-right followed by <SettingsIcon /> `Settings`
- Scroll down to the `Conversations` section and choose which notifications you want to receive. We recommend both new messages and new leads!
- Click `Save`
 
### Invite Your Team

To add team members so they can answer messages and help manage leads:

- Click on your profile icon in the top-right of the navigation
- Click `Invite Member` 
- Enter your teammate's email address and choose their role and permissions

When a teammate sends a message using Conversations you will see their profile picture next to the message.

## FAQs About Conversations

<details>
<summary>Can Conversations integrate with other CRMs or messaging systems?</summary>

Conversations does not directly integrate with external CRMs or messaging platforms. However, you can bring data from outside systems into your CRM, and use automations to send Conversations conversation data to other systems using integrations like Zapier or through custom workflows.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How can I automate tasks in Conversations?</summary>

Business App Automations let you create custom workflows using triggers (like a `Message Received`) and actions (such as `Send Email` or `Send SMS`). This helps you automate responses and actions based on specific rules and criteria.

You can also assign an AI Receptionist to automatically respond on certain channels for you. See [AI Workforce Overview](../ai/ai-workforce/ai_workforce_overview.md) for more details.

</details>

<details>
<summary>If we install the web chat on our website, will it be only AI answering customers or will real agents talk to customers?</summary>

The web chat is 100% AI-managed. If enough contact details are collected by the AI Receptionist, you will be able to send a message to them on Conversations using the appropriate channel.  

For more details, see [AI Web Chat Overview](conversations-ai-web-chat-overview.md).

</details>

<details>
<summary>How am I assigned a phone number?</summary>

When activating Conversations, you will be automatically assigned a phone number. First, the app will attempt to get a local number based on the business profile address. If no local numbers are available, a number from a neighbouring area in your country will be assigned. 

To see your assigned SMS phone number, navigate to `Settings > Conversations Settings > Your SMS number`. 

</details>

No. Those credits are separate.

No, it's not possible to send SMS messages to US numbers without A2P registration (A2P registration is not supported in Canada).

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I block spam message in Conversations?</summary>

Not at this time. Spammers can send messages to any number, and unfortunately spam messages have been sent to users of Conversations.
