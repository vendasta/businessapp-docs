### Sending Messages Through WhatsApp

Your options for sending a WhatsApp message are different based on your conversation history with your customer:

- If you are sending a WhatsApp message to someone who **has contacted you first**, you are free to write any message that meets WhatsApp guidelines.
- If you are sending a message to someone who **has not contacted you first**, you must reply using a WhatsApp template.

If your account is new and does not yet have any templates, the system will automatically submit a template for approval on your behalf. You can also create and submit additional templates anytime through the [Meta Business Help Center](https://business.facebook.com/latest/whatsapp_manager/message_templates).

:::info
Only approved templated messages can be sent as outbound cold messages. Once a customer initiates contact, you can reply with custom messages within a 24-hour window.
:::

**Key Notes:**

- Outbound messages are billed by Meta, not Business App.

## FAQs

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I connect an existing WhatsApp business account to Conversations AI, and still use the mobile app?</strong></summary>

Not currently. WhatsApp is working on a feature called "WhatsApp Coexistence," which is in closed beta. If a business has a WhatsApp for business account on their phone already, they can register a new (second) account for using with Conversations. In the future, we hope to support 'coexistence' as well.
