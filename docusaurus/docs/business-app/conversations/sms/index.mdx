SMS messaging in Business App is available for businesses located in Canada and the United States.

SMS is included in Conversations AI Pro, or can be purchased as a standalone product if you do not use the AI-assisted lead capture widget.

## For businesses based in the United States

US-based businesses must register before sending messages. Registration can take a few weeks. Once registered, you will receive a notification and can send your first message.

## For businesses in Canada, or US businesses that have completed registration

To send your first SMS message:

1. Open **Business App > Conversations** (or **Conversations AI** if you use that product).
2. Click the prompt to start sending messages.
3. Enter the customer's phone number. The field automatically formats the number (e.g., +1 (555) 555-5555).
4. Type your message and send.

### How do I add customer phone numbers?

When you send messages from Conversations, contacts are created automatically in Business App.

To add phone numbers manually, go to **CRM > Contacts** in the left-hand menu. You can add new contacts there or bulk import customers.

### How many messages can I send to customers?

With Conversations AI Pro or the standalone SMS product, you can send and receive unlimited one-to-one SMS and MMS messages. Each carrier may limit volume per day (for example, up to 2,000 SMS segments and MMS per day on T-Mobile).

### What phone number is used to send messages?

Your business is assigned an SMS number based on your business address. You can share this number with customers and receive text and MMS messages at it. This number does not accept voice calls.
