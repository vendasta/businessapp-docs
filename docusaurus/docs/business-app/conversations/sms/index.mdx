SMS messaging in Business App is available for businesses located in Canada and the United States. You can use Conversations to send and receive SMS and MMS messages with customers from a dedicated business phone number. Each business is assigned a local phone number for two-way communication based on your business address.

SMS is included in Conversations AI Pro, or can be purchased as a standalone product if you do not use the AI-assisted lead capture widget.

## SMS Registration and Setup

Before you can send SMS messages, you'll need to complete the registration and configuration process.

### For businesses based in the United States

US-based businesses must complete A2P 10DLC registration before sending SMS. This includes updating your website to meet carrier compliance requirements. Registration can take a few weeks. Once registered, you will receive a notification and can send your first message.

Canadian businesses can use SMS immediately without registration.
