# Home Overview

The Home page is your main dashboard - the first thing you see when logging into Business App. It provides an at-a-glance view of your business performance and quick access to key features.

## What You'll See

- **Key Metrics**: Performance data organized into Impressions, Engagement, and Leads
- **Recent Activity**: Live feed of messages, calls, and customer interactions
- **Business Profile**: Quick access to your location info and profile management
- **Products & Services**: Available offerings and store integration
- **Get Started Guide**: Setup assistance if you're new to Business App

## Marketing Funnel

The Marketing Funnel displays key metrics in three easy-to-understand categories, helping you see how your marketing efforts drive business results.

### How It Works

The Marketing Funnel organizes performance data into:

- **Impressions**: Views of your online content (Google Business Profile views, social media reach)
- **Engagement**: Interactions with your business content (website visits, reviews, calls)
- **Leads**: New prospects from multiple sources (phone calls, SMS, forms, automations)

This gives you a clear view of your marketing performance without needing to dig into detailed reports.

## Invite Team Member

You can invite additional team members to access your Business App account.

### How to Invite a Team Member

1. Log into **Business App**.
2. From the **Home page**, select **Invite Team Member** on the top right of the page.
3. Enter the first name, last name, and email address of the team member you want to invite.
4. Click **Send Invite**.

The invited team member will receive an email with instructions to join and access the Business App account.
