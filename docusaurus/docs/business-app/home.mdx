# Home Overview

The Home page is your clients' main dashboard - the first thing they see when logging into Business App. It provides an at-a-glance view of business performance and quick access to key features.

- **Business Profile**: Quick access to location info and profile management
- **Products & Services**: Available offerings and store integration
- **Get Started Guide**: For new users who need setup assistance

## Partner Customization

Navigate to **Partner Center > Administration > Customize Business App > Pages > Home** to control:

- **Marketing Funnel**: Toggle key metrics display
- **Recent Activity**: Show/hide activity feed
- **Sales Summary**: Display ecommerce order summaries
- **Default Reporting Period**: Set timeframe for metrics

## Marketing Funnel

The Marketing Funnel displays key metrics from the Executive Report in three easy-to-understand categories, helping your clients see how their marketing efforts drive business results.

### How It Works

The Marketing Funnel organizes performance data into:

- **Impressions**: Views of online content (Google Business Profile views, social media reach)
- **Engagement**: Interactions with business content (website visits, reviews, calls)
- **Leads**: New prospects from multiple sources (phone calls, SMS, forms, automations)

This gives clients a clear view of their marketing performance without needing to dig into detailed reports.

## Invite Team Member

The **Invite Team Member** option allows Business App users to invite additional team members.

### How to Invite a Team Member

1. Log into **Business App**.  
2. From the **Home page**, select **Invite Team Member** on the top right of the page.  
3. Enter the first name, last name, and email address of the team member you want to invite.  
4. Click **Send Invite**.

The invited team member will receive an email with instructions to join and access the Business App account.
