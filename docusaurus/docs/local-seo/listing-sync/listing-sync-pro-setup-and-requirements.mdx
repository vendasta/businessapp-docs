## Before you start

- Ensure accurate name, address, phone number, website, and categories are added in the `Business Profile`.
- Prepare a unique local phone number for the business.
- Use a physical street address (PO Boxes are not supported).

## Authentication

- Listings managed by Listing Sync Pro generally do not require you to authenticate accounts on supported directories.
- Google, Facebook, Instagram, and X, authentication is required within those platforms to sync data.

## Claiming profiles

- Google Business Profile must be claimed directly through Google. This product does not claim Google profiles on your behalf.
- Prioritize claiming major sources such as Google, Bing, Apple, and Yelp. 

## Address and PO boxes

- Using a PO Box as the business address prevents syncing. Enter a physical street address instead. If you prefer to hide the address publicly, select the service‑area business option where supported.

## Shared phone numbers or addresses

- A unique local phone number is critical. Directory networks and aggregators use this for matching. Reuse of a phone number across businesses can prevent syndication.
- Address data is validated against authoritative postal sources to avoid duplication.

## Alternate phone & website syndication

### What is alternate phone & website syndication?

Alternate phone & website syndication lets you override your default business profile phone number and website URL on specific platforms, such as Google Business Profile, Facebook and Bing.

### Why is alternate phone & website syndication important?

This feature allows businesses to customize which phone number or website appears on each major platform, such as Google, Facebook, and Bing. By tailoring contact details per source, you can better understand where leads and interactions are coming from, enhance campaign attribution, and guide organic traffic to the most effective landing pages.

### What's included with alternate phone & website syndication?

- Platform-specific override options for phone numbers and websites
- Support for Google Business Profile, Facebook and Bing.

### Key behavior
