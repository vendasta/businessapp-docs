## What are Automation Templates?
Automation templates are pre-built workflows that help you set up common automations, quickly. Templates provide a structured starting point with a trigger, optional conditions, and one or more action steps. You can customize them to suit your specific needs.

Templates are helpful for saving time, ensuring consistency, and guiding you through best-practice automation design. Instead of building a workflow from scratch, templates allow you to:

- Speed up setup and implementation
- Reduce configuration errors
- Start from a proven, structured example
- Modify as needed without needing to know every feature in the builder
