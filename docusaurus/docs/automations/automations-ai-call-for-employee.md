# Call an AI Employee from Automations

This `Automations` feature is called `Call an AI Employee`. This allows you to send a request, or prompt, to an AI Employee and then use the AI's response as part of a workflow.

A template, "Form submission - Auto-reply with AI Chat Receptionist custom message," uses this feature to let the AI Receptionist automatically send a helpful, unique reply to a contact after they submit a form.

When a potential customer fills out a form on your website, this automation allows your AI Receptionist to respond to them immediately via SMS and email. The AI can use the context of the form to answer the person's questions directly and confirm that their submission has been received.
