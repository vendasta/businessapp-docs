## What is the Pause Campaign action?

The **Pause Campaign** action in the automation builder allows you to automatically stop campaigns for a contact or an entire company when specific conditions are met. These actions ensure your outreach stays relevant and reduces manual intervention.

## Why is the Pause Campaign action important?

Campaigns should align with the real-time status of leads. The **Pause Campaign** actions allow you to automatically pause campaigns based on dynamic lead conditions, keeping communication timely and relevant.

## How you can use the Pause Campaign action

You can insert these actions into any automation to pause ongoing campaigns:

| Action                    | Description                                                  |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Pause campaign for contact | Stops campaigns for a specific contact                       |
| Pause campaign for company | Stops campaigns for all contacts within a specific company   |

These actions are especially useful when used with conditional triggers such as:

- `Wait until meeting is booked`
- `Check if email bounced`
- `Evaluate lead score or CRM field`
