## What is Pause Campaign?

The **Pause Campaign** actions in the automation builder allow you to automatically stop campaigns for a contact or an entire company when specific conditions are met. These actions ensure your outreach stays relevant and reduces manual intervention.

## Why is Pause Campaign Important?

Campaigns should align with the real-time status of leads. Previously, campaigns would continue running regardless of changes such as:

- A contact booking a meeting
- An email bouncing
- A lead becoming unqualified or disengaged

This caused:

- **Overcommunication**: Leads received outdated or irrelevant messaging.
- **Manual work**: Campaigns had to be paused manually.

The new **Pause Campaign** actions allow you to automatically pause campaigns based on dynamic lead conditions, keeping communication timely and relevant.

## What You Can Do with Pause Campaign

You can insert these actions into any automation to pause ongoing campaigns:

| Action                    | Description                                                  |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Pause campaign for contact | Stops campaigns for a specific contact                       |
| Pause campaign for company | Stops campaigns for all contacts within a specific company   |

These actions are especially useful when used with conditional triggers such as:

- `Wait until meeting is booked`
- `Check if email bounced`
- `Evaluate lead score or CRM field`
