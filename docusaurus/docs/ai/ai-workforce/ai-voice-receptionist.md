Your AI Voice Receptionist helps answer your calls 24/7, captures new-lead info, gives callers fast and accurate answers, and helps get questions to the right person when they don't have an answer. 

**In this guide, you will learn:**
- What you need to get started with your AI Voice Receptionist
- How to configure basic settings
- How to test performance and troubleshoot
- Where to find answers to frequently asked questions or for deeper integration guides

## Why use an AI Voice Receptionist?

When a customer calls a business, they are usually a high-intent lead that wants to get an answer and get it fast. If a customer *doesn't* receive an answer, they will move on to calling the next business. 

Having an AI Voice Receptionist helps stop customers from moving on to the next business by at minimum answering their questions and potentially even booking an appointment. While some customers may prefer speaking to a human, being able to speak to someone representing the business is an improvement over not being able to answer the phone at all.

## Setting up the AI Voice Receptionist

### AI Voice Receptionist Call Flow & Routing

There are a number of ways to route calls to and from your Voice Receptionist to ensure that you never miss a lead.

![AI Voice Receptionist Call Flow](../../ai-voice-receptionist-call-flow.png)

#### Routing phone calls to your AI Voice Receptionist

To have your Voice Receptionist handle calls for your business, you can:

1. **Direct calls to your Conversations number**  
Calls made directly to your Conversations phone number are sent to your AI Receptionist automatically.

2. **Forward calls from your business line to your Voice Receptionist**  
Customers can keep calling your existing business number and your telephone provider can then forward calls to your Conversations number. 

   Depending on your phone provider and telephone system your options to forward calls might include:
   - Forwarding all calls to your Conversations number
   - Forwarding calls to your Conversations number after a certain number of rings
   - Forwarding calls automatically after-hours

:::tip
For more help forwarding calls, see [Call Forwarding Setup in Conversations](/img/docs/conversations/conversations-setup-phone-calls.md).
:::

#### Handling calls from your AI Voice Receptionist

Once a call reaches your AI Voice Receptionist, there are a number of potential ways the call can be handled:

1. **AI Voice Receptionist answers calls**  
   The AI greets callers, answers FAQs using your knowledge base, captures contact details, and can book appointments.
  
2. **Forward calls**  
   The call is routed to another phone number automatically.
  
3. **End with a custom message**  
   A branded or informational message is played before the call is ended automatically.
  
4. **Missed-call SMS**  
   A text message is sent to callers, prompting them to leave a voicemail or schedule a callback.

:::note
While this guide will cover accessing these other options, it will focus on setting up the AI Voice Receptionist answer calls. For more detail on using the other options, see [Conversations Settings](/administration/conversations-settings.md).

### Step 1: Set up your AI Voice Receptionist Persona and Communication Channels
While your AI Voice Receptionist is capable of being a great representative for your business with very little configuration, there are a few things you can do to make them feel more on brand with your business and ensure they are set up correctly.

To get started, go to <AISparkleIcon /> `AI > AI Workforce` and click `Configure` on the Voice Receptionist. 

#### Set your AI Voice Receptionist's name and image

Give your AI Voice Receptionist a friendly, professional name and upload a photo or icon. Your Voice Receptionist will use this name when speaking to callers, and the photo helps you quickly identify it among your other AI Employees in the app. 

#### Choose your AI Voice Receptionist's voice

Under the `Profile` accordion, click on the `Speech` tab to reveal the dropdown for `Voice family` and `Voice`. Pick a voice family and voice that matches your brand. You can preview the different voices by selecting a `Voice` and clicking on the play arrow. 

:::tip Voice family and voice capabilities
Each voice family and voice have different strengths and weaknesses like response speed, expressiveness, and multi-lingual capabilities. While you will see a "Recommended" voice family and voice for your business, you can choose a different voice if you prefer!
:::

#### Choose your AI Voice Receptionist's communication channels
Under the `Channels` section, you will see all of the channels the AI Voice Receptionist can be assigned to work with. Your AI Voice Receptionist should be assigned to the Conversations AI phone number by default. 

### Step 2: Configure Your AI Voice Receptionist Capabilities

Your AI Voice Receptionist has a number of capabilities available by default that let them take calls like a human receptionist would. 

You can:
- Enable or disable these capabilities as needed
- Edit or configure the prompt for each capability
- Add new custom capabilities to expand their skills.

:::info Learn more about Capabilities
For more detailed information on Capabilities, see the [AI Workforce Overview](./ai_workforce_overview.md#capabilities).
:::

#### Default voice lead capture for AI Voice Receptionist
The **default voice lead capture** capability guides your AI Employee to offer to help customers by answering questions and then gathering their contact information. This capability is turned on by default. 

> **Note:** It this is turned off, the Voice Receptionist will not be able to capture caller information but *will* still answer questions to the best of their ability.


#### Book appointments with your calendar

The **Book appointments with calendar** capability connects to your integrated calendar, enabling the AI Voice Receptionist to offer real-time availability to callers, collect all necessary booking details, and automatically create events on your calendar. 

On the `Book appointments with calendar` panel, use the `Select event link to book with` dropdown to choose which calendar your receptionst should use to determine availability as well as which kind of appointments they can offer.

#### Additional Instructions for AI Voice Receptionist

The **Additional Instructions** capability lets you give your AI Voice Receptionist custom guidance to shape its responses, tone, and logic. It sits at the top of the AIâ€™s prompt stack to refine how it interacts with callers. 

To add additional instructions, click on the `Additional Instructions` tab in the Capabilities panel. From there you can write plain language instructions to your AI Voice Receptionist. 

Some examples of instructions you might want to add include:
- `Ask for the caller's address`
- `Do not promise a price`
- `If the caller asks to speak to a human, let them know you can't connect them with one today, but you can take a message and have them call back.`

#### Add a capability to your AI Voice Receptionist

You can extend your AI Voice Receptionist's capabilities by building your own custom capabilities. By adding your own "Tools" to custom capabilities, you can give your AI Voice Receptionist the ability to perform tasks that are specific to your business and build connections with other software you use.

:::info Learn more about custom capabilities
For more details on creating custom capabilities, see [Empower Your AI Employee with Custom Capabilities](./empower-your-ai-employee-custom-capabilities.md).
:::


### Step 3: Add Knowledge Sources to your AI Voice Receptionist

The `Knowledge sources` panel lets you choose which information your AI Voice Receptionist can reference when answering calls. When your Voice Receptionist does not immediately have an answer to a caller's question, they will let the caller know they are taking a moment to look up information. If the Receptionist doesn't find the answer, they will let the caller know they don't have the information and offer to take a message and have someone call them back.

By default your Voice Receptionist has access to your:
- **Business Profile**:
Information shown in common business listings sites such as Services, Hours, and contact info. 
- **Website Homepage content**: 
Any relevant information available on your website's homepage that is written in text. 

If you need to add more detailed information for your AI Receptionist, you can use the `Add knowledge` bar to `+ Add new knowledge`. From here you can add text, website, or file information to your Knowledge Base and immediately have it available to your AI Voice Receptionist.

:::tip Learn more about Knowledge Sources

## Test and Monitor Your AI Voice Receptionist

Once your AI Voice Receptionist is set up, itâ€™s important to test how it handles real calls and monitor its performance over time. This helps you ensure the AI is providing accurate answers, capturing leads, and delivering a professional experience to your callers. Regular testing and review will also help you spot opportunities to improve your AIâ€™s responses as your business grows.

### Testing and Reviewing the AI Voice Receptionistâ€™s Responses

Click the `Try it` button on your AI Voice Receptionist's card from <AISparkleIcon /> `AI > AI Workforce` to quickly see the phone number assigned to your AI Voice Receptionist.

Before going live with your AI Voice Receptionist, you should test their responses to make sure they are performing how you would like when:
- Greeting callers 
- Asking for and recording information
- Answering common questions accurately
- Offering to take a message and have someone call the caller back if they don't have an answer
- Offering to book an appointment with your calendar

### Monitor and Improve the AI Voice Receptionist

You can review call recordings and transcripts of of the conversations your AI Voice Receptionist has with callers by going to the `Conversations` tab in Business App. 

By reviewing the call recording and transcripts regularly, you can see how your AI Voice Receptionist is performing and make adjustments to your configuration as needed. 

:::note
