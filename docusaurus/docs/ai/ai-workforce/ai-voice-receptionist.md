## Set Up the AI Voice Receptionist

### Step 1: Configure Basic Settings for the AI Voice Receptionist

Go to <AISparkleIcon /> `AI > AI Workforce` and click `Configure` on the Voice Receptionist.

- **Name and image**  
Give your AI Voice Receptionist a friendly, professional name and upload a photo or icon. The AI will use this name when speaking to callers, and the photo helps you quickly identify it among your other AI Employees in the app.

Pick a voice family and voice that matches your brand. Each voice family and voice have different strengths and weaknesses like response speed, expressiveness, and multi-lingual capabilities.

- **Communication channels**  
Ensure your AI Voice Receptionist is assigned to the provided Conversations phone number by checking the checkbox next to `Answers phone calls`.

:::info  
The AI Voice Receptionist can only answer calls made to the phone number provided by Conversations. If you want your main business number or other numbers to be answered by the AI, you can set up call forwarding to route calls to your Conversations phone number. For step-by-step instructions, see [How to forward calls to your AI Voice Receptionist in Phone Settings](link-to-forwarding-guide).

    The AI will automatically ask callers for their contact information and save new leads directly to your CRM. This is turned on by default.

    Connect your calendar to let the AI help customers schedule meetings. It will offer available time slots and collect all necessary booking details automatically. 

- **Custom Capabilities**  
    Expand your AI Voice Receptionist’s skills by adding custom capabilities tailored to your unique business needs. You can learn more about making [Custom Capabilities](./empower-your-ai-employee-custom-capabilities.md) in depth.

### Step 3: Add Business Knowledge to your AI Voice Receptionist

To answer questions accurately, your AI Voice Receptionist needs up-to-date information! If the information doesn't need to be gathered using a Tool from a custom capability, the right place to have information is in the Knowledge Base.

By default your AI Voice Receptionist has access to your Business Profile and the homepage of your website to help answer questions. 

For more best practices on the Knowledge Base, see the [AI Workforce Overview](./ai_workforce_overview.md#training-your-ai-employees-purpose-and-knowledge).

## Test and Monitor Your AI Voice Receptionist

Once your AI Voice Receptionist is set up, it’s important to test how it handles real calls and monitor its performance over time. This helps you ensure the AI is providing accurate answers, capturing leads, and delivering a professional experience to your callers. Regular testing and review will also help you spot opportunities to improve your AI’s responses as your business grows.

### Test the AI Voice Receptionist’s Responses

Click the `Try it` button from <AISparkleIcon /> `AI > AI Workforce` to quickly see the phone number your AI Voice Receptionist will answer from. 

- Listen for:  
  - How the AI greets callers  
  - Whether it asks for and records the right information  
  - How it answers common questions

### Monitor and Improve the AI Voice Receptionist

Regularly review the conversations in the `Conversations` tab to make sure your AI Voice Receptionist is handling calls and leads the way you expect.

The call recording and transcripts can help show you:
- How the AI greeted the caller
- What information was captured (like name, phone number, and reason for calling)
- How common questions were answered

:::note  
If the AI Voice Receptionist is unable to capture a caller’s contact information, those calls may appear without all contact details in your Conversations. This helps you identify missed opportunities or trends to improve on.

Reviewing these details can help you fine-tune your Knowledge Base and AI instructions for even better results.
