By connecting the AI Chat Receptionist with ServiceTitan, your AI Receptionist can access customer information, schedule appointments, and manage service requests in your ServiceTitan account.

**In this guide, you will set up your AI Receptionist to be able to:**
- Look up customer information and service history;
- Schedule new appointments and service calls;
- Check technician availability and capacity;
- Create and update jobs in ServiceTitan;
- Retrieve real-time job status and updates; and
- Access customer billing and invoice information.

### Why is connecting the AI Receptionist with ServiceTitan important?

ServiceTitan is a software platform used by many trades businesses (HVAC, plumbing, electrical, and other home services). When customers contact your business, they often need help with scheduling, job updates, or service history. This integration lets your AI Receptionist read and update data in ServiceTitan, such as customers, jobs, appointments, and related records.

:::tip
While this guide has been written primarily for your AI Chat Receptionist, you can use the Capabilities created in this guide with your AI Voice Receptionist, or any other AI Employee!

**Do not search** if the customer is asking general questions about services, pricing, or company policies.

---

### Customer Search Process

**Step 1: Search for Customer**
1. Use the most specific identifier provided (phone number is usually most reliable)
2. If searching by name, use the full name or last name for better results
3. If multiple customers match, ask for additional identifying information

**Step 2: Handle Customer Status**
- **If customer found:** Retrieve their job history and note upcoming appointments
- **If customer not found:** Prepare to create a new customer record

**Step 3: Retrieve Service History (for existing customers)**
1. Once you have the customer ID, retrieve their job history
2. Look for patterns in service frequency, preferred technicians, or recurring issues
3. Note any upcoming appointments or pending work orders

### Response Guidelines

**When customer is found:**
- Greet them by name and acknowledge their customer status
- Provide relevant service history if they're asking about past work
- Mention upcoming appointments if applicable
- Offer to help with scheduling or service questions

**When customer is not found:**
- Welcome them as a new customer
- Explain that you'll create their account during the service booking process
- Gather necessary information (name, phone, email, service address)
- Use the `createCustomer` tool if they want to proceed with scheduling

**For new customer creation, collect:**
- Full name
- Phone number
- Email address
- Service address (street, city, state, zip code)
- Any special access instructions

**Security Note:**
- Only provide account details to the verified account holder
- Ask for verification if there are any concerns about identity
- Do not share sensitive information like full addresses or payment details

### Example Responses

**Existing Customer:**
"Hi [Customer Name]! I found your account in our system. I can see you're one of our valued customers with [X] service history. How can I help you today?"

**New Customer:**
"Welcome! I don't see an existing account with that information, which means you'll be a new customer. That's no problem at all - I can set up your account and schedule your service. Let me gather some basic information to get started."

### Example 2: New Customer Requesting Service

<ChatUserMessage>
Hi, my kitchen sink has been leaking and I need a plumber. Can someone come out this week?
</ChatUserMessage>

<ChatAIMessage>
I can definitely help you get a plumber scheduled for that kitchen sink leak. Let me first look up your information. What's your name and phone number?
</ChatAIMessage>

<ChatUserMessage>
I'm Sarah Williams, phone number is (555) 987-6543. I think this might be my first time calling your company.
</ChatUserMessage>

*(AI searches ServiceTitan but finds no existing customer)*

<ChatAIMessage>
Welcome, Sarah! You're right - I don't see an existing account, which means you'll be a new customer. That's no problem at all! I can set up your account and get that plumber scheduled for you.

Let me gather some basic information to get started:

1. I have your name as Sarah Williams and phone (555) 987-6543
2. What's your email address?
3. What's the service address where you need the plumbing work done?

Also, can you tell me more about the kitchen sink leak? Is it under the sink, from the faucet, or somewhere else?
</ChatAIMessage>

<ChatUserMessage>
My email is sarah.williams@email.com and the address is 456 Oak Street, Springfield, IL 62701. The leak is coming from under the sink - looks like it's from one of the pipes connecting to the garbage disposal.
</ChatUserMessage>

*(AI creates new customer in ServiceTitan and checks technician availability)*

<ChatAIMessage>
Thank you, Sarah! I've created your account and can see this sounds like a plumbing connection issue that definitely needs attention. 

I have these available appointment slots this week:

**Friday, March 17th:**
- 9:00 AM - 11:00 AM

Given that it's an active leak, I'd recommend sooner rather than later. In the meantime, you might want to place a bucket under the leak and avoid using the garbage disposal if possible. Which time slot works best for you?
</ChatAIMessage>

<ChatUserMessage>
Wednesday at 10 AM would be great!

### AI & Workflow Questions

<details>
<summary>How does the ServiceTitan integration work with my AI's Knowledge Base?</summary>

The ServiceTitan integration provides real-time operational data through API calls, while your [Knowledge Base](../knowledge-base.md) contains static business information. These work together as follows:

**ServiceTitan API provides:** Live job status, customer history, technician schedules, real-time availability  
**Knowledge Base should include:** Service policies, pricing information, service area details, company procedures, emergency protocols

Your AI will use the ServiceTitan API to answer "When is my next appointment?" and the Knowledge Base to answer "What's your service area?" For best results, ensure your [Knowledge Sources](./ai_workforce_overview.md#knowledge-sources) include comprehensive business policies and procedures to complement the real-time operational data.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What if customers ask about ServiceTitan-related information the API can't provide?</summary>

Great question! The ServiceTitan API provides operational and customer data, but customers often need additional business information. Add these topics to your [Knowledge Base](../knowledge-base.md):

- Service area boundaries and travel charges
- Emergency service policies and after-hours rates
- Warranty information and terms
- Payment methods and financing options
- Seasonal service recommendations
- Equipment maintenance tips
- Company history and certifications
- Environmental and safety policies

This ensures your AI can provide complete, helpful answers by combining real-time ServiceTitan data with your business policies and expertise.
</details>

### Business Process Questions

<details>
<summary>How can I ensure my AI creates jobs with the right priority and routing?</summary>

ServiceTitan's job management system relies on proper classification and routing. Configure your AI integration to:

**Set Appropriate Priority Levels:**
- Emergency (no heat/cool, water leaks, electrical hazards)
- Urgent (equipment malfunctions, comfort issues)
- Routine (maintenance, non-critical repairs)

**Include Detailed Job Information:**
- Clear problem descriptions from customer conversations
- Equipment details when known (age, model, previous service)
- Access requirements (gate codes, pet information)
- Customer preferences (technician requests, time windows)

**Route to Qualified Technicians:**
- Match job types to technician specializations
- Consider geographic routing for efficiency
- Factor in equipment requirements and truck stock

You can customize the job creation prompts to automatically gather this information during customer conversations.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can customers get estimates and pricing through the AI integration?</summary>

While ServiceTitan stores pricing and estimate data, providing accurate estimates requires careful consideration:

**What the AI can do:**
- Reference standard service call fees from your Knowledge Base
- Mention typical price ranges for common services
- Schedule estimate appointments with technicians
- Access historical pricing for repeat services

**What requires human expertise:**
- Detailed troubleshooting and diagnosis
- Complex repair estimates
- Equipment replacement recommendations
- Custom work pricing

We recommend having your AI schedule estimate appointments for anything beyond basic service calls, ensuring customers get accurate, professional assessments from your technicians.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do I handle emergency service requests through the AI?</summary>

Emergency services require special handling to ensure rapid response:

**Configure Emergency Workflows:**
- Create high-priority job types for emergencies (no heat, water leaks, electrical hazards)
- Set up immediate dispatch notifications
- Include emergency contact escalation in your prompts
- Provide clear safety instructions while help is on the way

**Update Your AI Prompts:**
- Add emergency identification criteria
- Include safety questions and immediate response instructions
- Escalate to on-call staff when appropriate
- Create emergency job entries with highest priority

**Example Emergency Response:**
"I understand you have no heat and it's freezing outside. This is definitely an emergency. I'm creating a high-priority service call right now and will have our emergency dispatch contact you within 10 minutes. In the meantime, if you have a space heater, please use it safely..."
</details>

### Technical & Advanced Configuration

<details>
<summary>How can I track which services customers request most through AI interactions?</summary>

Monitor customer service patterns through several methods:

1. **Conversation Analytics:** Review the [Conversations](../../conversations/conversations_overview.md) tab to identify frequently requested services

2. **ServiceTitan Reporting:** Use ServiceTitan's built-in reporting to track jobs created through AI interactions by tagging them appropriately

3. **Custom Capability Analytics:** Monitor which API calls are made most frequently through the "Explanation" feature

4. **Business Intelligence:** Set up [automations](../../automations/app_settings_automations.md) to log AI-generated appointments and analyze trends

This data can inform staffing, inventory, and service offerings based on customer demand patterns.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I customize the AI's responses based on customer membership levels or service agreements?</summary>

Yes! ServiceTitan's customer data includes membership and service agreement information that your AI can use:

**Membership Benefits:**
- Priority scheduling for members
- Discounted rates and special pricing
- Extended warranties and guarantees
- Expedited service response

**Service Agreement Holders:**
- Scheduled maintenance reminders
- Covered services under agreement
- Member-only time slots
- Special contact procedures

Customize your prompts to check customer status and adjust responses accordingly. For example: "I see you're a Premium Service Member, so I can offer you priority scheduling and your annual maintenance is included at no charge."
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do I ensure data privacy and security with the ServiceTitan integration?</summary>

Data security is crucial when integrating customer information systems:

**API Security Best Practices:**
- Use secure OAuth 2.0 authentication
- Implement proper access token management
- Limit API permissions to minimum required scopes
- Monitor API access and usage regularly

**Customer Data Protection:**
- Only access customer data when necessary for the conversation
- Verify customer identity before providing account details
- Follow your company's data privacy policies
- Comply with relevant regulations (CCPA, GDPR, etc.)

**System Security:**
- Regularly update API credentials
- Monitor for unusual access patterns
- Implement logging for audit purposes
- Train staff on data handling procedures

The integration respects ServiceTitan's existing permission structure, so customers can only access information they're authorized to see.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I create automated follow-up workflows based on job completion?</summary>

You can create follow-up workflows using ServiceTitan webhooks and Business App automations:

**Job Completion Follow-ups:**
- Automatic customer satisfaction surveys
- Service reminder scheduling for maintenance
- Follow-up appointment booking for warranty work
- Review request campaigns for positive experiences

**Implementation Options:**
1. Use ServiceTitan webhooks to trigger Business App [automations](../../automations/app_settings_automations.md)
2. Set up [Zapier](../../automations/zapier.md) integrations between ServiceTitan and Business App
3. Create scheduled follow-up tasks in your AI workflow

**Example Workflow:**
When a ServiceTitan job is marked "Completed" → trigger Business App automation → send personalized follow-up message through AI Receptionist → schedule satisfaction survey → book next maintenance appointment if needed.

This provides a consistent customer experience beyond the initial service call.
