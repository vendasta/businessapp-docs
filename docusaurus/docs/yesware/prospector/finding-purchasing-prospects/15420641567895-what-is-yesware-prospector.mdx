# What is Yesware Prospector?

**Yesware Prospector** is a lead-generation tool built into the Yesware app that allows you to discover **net new contacts** using advanced filters. With just a few clicks, you can create fully enriched profiles from your search results using **1 account credit per contact**.
Prospector and Enrichment credits are available as **add-ons** to your Yesware plan.
### Searching for Prospects
- From the Yesware **app site**, go to the **Prospector** tab. 
- Use the filter panel to define your search criteria. You must fill in **at least one field**, but the more filters you use, the more precise your results will be.
**Available filters include:**
- Job title
- Seniority
- Location
- Company name
- Company size
- Industry
- Company website
- Name (Outlook only)
**Advanced options** also let you limit results to contacts with:
- A **LinkedIn profile**
- A **phone number**
- Click **Search** to generate your results.
### Creating Contacts from Prospects
Once your results appear, you can turn selected prospects into Contacts using available credits. The workflow differs slightly between Gmail and Outlook: 
#### Gmail
- Click on **Contacts** from the left pane.
- Hit **“New Contact”** and enter the information.*(Each new contact uses 1 credit.)*
#### Outlook
From the Prospector results page:
- Check the box next to one or more prospects, or click **“Select All.”**
- Click **“Create Contact.”***(Each selected contact uses 1 credit.)*
Once created, your new contacts will appear in the **Contacts tab** with a full, enriched profile.
