# How Do I Convert My Prospects Into Contacts?

Yesware allows you to easily convert Prospects into Contacts for further engagement and tracking. The process is nearly identical whether you're using Gmail or Outlook.
**Step 1: Select your Prospects**
After generating a list of Prospects, check the box next to each Prospect you wish to convert.
To select all Prospects on the current page, use the **“Select All”** option.
**Step 2: Create Contacts**
Click **“Create Contact.”**
Keep in mind: creating **1 contact uses 1 credit**, so ensure you have enough credits available in your account before proceeding.
**Step 3: View your new Contacts**
In **Outlook**, your new Contacts will appear in your **Contacts page**.
In **Gmail**, you can find your Contacts on the **Contacts page** or via the **Gmail Contacts Sidebar tab**.
