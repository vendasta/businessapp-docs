# How Do I Search For Prospects?

To initiate your search for new prospects, navigate to the [Prospector tab](https://app.yesware.com/users/sign_in) within the Yesware app site.Â 
To start your search for new prospects, you must fill in at least one filter. (Job Title, Seniority, Location, Company Name, Industry, Location, Company Website, and First/Last Name.)
We recommend filling in more than one filter in order to get more targeted results.
Prospector exclusively furnishes results with email addresses, and by default, our advanced settings ensure availability of 'phone numbers' and 'LinkedIn profiles' for these results. You have the option to deselect the last two advanced settings boxes, if desired.
Once you've configured your filters, click on the SEARCH button. The number of results will be displayed in the top right corner, allowing you to proceed with your prospecting efforts.
