# Can I add a GIF to my campaign?

GIFs can be inserted into a **Yesware Campaign signature.** Since the Campaign signature requires you to insert an 'image source' instead of uploading directly from your computer you will need to first insert the GIF into a Template to capture the image source ID.
**You can do this using the following steps: **
1. Open up your Template tool &gt; New Template &gt; Insert/edit Image and select the GIF you would like to use. 
2. Upon selecting the GIF, toggle over to 'Image URL', and highlight the url that appears in the 'Source' area. 
3. Go to your Campaign tool &gt; New Campaign &gt; Edit signature &gt; Insert/edit image &amp; paste the copied URL.
From there you will be able to resize the GIF as needed and make any additional changes to your signature. Once you save the signature it will be saved and included at the bottom of all of your campaign messages. 
**Please note that each user will need to complete these steps, as we do not have a way for this to be rolled out to all users universally. **
