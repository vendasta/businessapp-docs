# Can I see recipients of campaigns?

Users cannot view the recipients of another team member's campaigns. However, each team member can access the details of their own campaigns by navigating to the campaign and clicking on the **"Recipients"**Â section. For privacy and security reasons, this information is kept confidential and is only visible to the account holder.
