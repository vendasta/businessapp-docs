# How do I export a CSV from Salesforce to use with Campaigns?

### How can Gmail and Outlooks users export a CSV from SFDC to use with campaigns?
In order to use Yesware's Campaigns at scale, you may need to upload a CSV that contains the data that you'd like to merge into your emails. While this spreadsheet can be created manually, exporting a list from Salesforce can save you even more time!
Create a new Report in Salesforce. Depending on what information you're trying to pull together, this report could be based on Accounts, Leads, Contacts, or Opportunities.
### Salesforce Lightning
In the report builder, select the fields that you'd like to include in the email. NOTE: Email *must* be the first column of your report.
At the top of your report, click "Run" and then the down arrow and "Export" button. Select "Details Only" Finally, select "Comma Delimited .csv" as the "Export File Format" and click Export. 
Now you're ready to [upload the file](/docs/campaigns/managing-active-campaigns/how-can-i-add-recipients-to-a) into Yesware's Campaigns feature!
