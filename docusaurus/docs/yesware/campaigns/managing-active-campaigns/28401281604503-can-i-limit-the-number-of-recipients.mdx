# Can I limit the number of recipients receiving campaign emails for larger recipient lists?

Currently, **Yesware does not provide a way to limit the number of recipients** for campaign emails when dealing with larger recipient lists. There is no throttle or toggle feature to send emails in smaller batches within a larger recipient pool.
**Workaround**:
To manage the number of emails being sent, you can:
- Adjust the **timing of adding recipients** to campaigns, sending smaller batches at different times.
- Modify the **frequency of touchpoints** within campaigns to control the flow of emails.
While these are not perfect solutions, they can help you manage email volume more effectively.
