# My .CSV File Won't Upload to my Campaign

If you're having trouble uploading a .CSV file to a Campaign, review the following formatting requirements to ensure your file is compatible:
The **Email** column must be the first column, in **Column A**.
All **column headings must exactly match** the Merge Fields used in your email. For example, a column labeled `FirstName` will not work with the merge field `\{!First\}`.
Each row must include a valid **email address**. Do not leave blank linesâ€”uploading will stop at the first row without an email.
Remove **any unused columns, rows, or extra tabs**. Only include information you intend to use in your Campaign.
Your file **must be saved as a .CSV**. Most spreadsheet programs default to `.xlsx`, so be sure to select **"Comma Separated Values (.csv)"** as the file type when saving.
Following these best practices should resolve most upload issues.
