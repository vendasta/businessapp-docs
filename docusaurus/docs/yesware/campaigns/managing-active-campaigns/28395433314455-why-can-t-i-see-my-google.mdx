# Why Can't I See My Google Signature in the Campaign Preview?

### Why Can't I See My Google Signature in the Campaign Preview?
If you’re using the "Include Google Signature" option when creating an email touch or campaign, you may notice that the Google signature does not appear in the campaign preview. This is intentional and part of the platform’s functionality.
### How It Works
**In the Preview:** The Google signature will not display in the email preview, even if the "Include Google Signature" option is toggled on.
**In Sent Emails:** The Google signature will be included in the emails sent to recipients, as long as the Gmail account associated with the campaign has a signature properly set up.
### Steps to Ensure Your Google Signature Appears in Sent Emails
**Enable the "Include Google Signature" Option:** While creating your email touch or campaign, make sure this option is toggled on.
**Verify Your Gmail Signature:** Ensure your Gmail account has an active signature set up.
To check or configure your Gmail signature, go to your Gmail settings and update the "Signature" section.
If your Gmail signature is not set up, it will not appear in the emails, even if the feature is enabled.
