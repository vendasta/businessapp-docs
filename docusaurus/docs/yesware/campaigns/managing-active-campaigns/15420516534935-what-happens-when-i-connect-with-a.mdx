# What happens when I connect with a recipient on a Campaign?

### What happens when an Outlook or Gmail user connects with a recipient in a campaign?
By default, we remove recipients from a Campaign when they "connect" with you, meaning that they will not receive any subsequent touches in the Campaign if there are any. A "connect" means that they replied to your email, you spoke to them on the phone as a result of a [phone call touch](/docs/general/how-do-i-take-an-action-on), or they booked a meeting with your [Meeting Scheduler](/docs/general/can-i-add-a-meeting-scheduler-link) link.
When creating a new Campaign, you are able to choose whether or not you want to "Remove recipients after connection," which means that Yesware will automatically remove a recipient from the Campaign once they connect. If you’d like to keep a recipient in a Campaign regardless of whether or not they reply to an email, you speak to them on the phone, or they book a meeting, simply un-check the "Remove recipients after connection" box in the "Settings" section of the Campaign.
