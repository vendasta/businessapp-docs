# How can I add recipients to a Campaign?

Yesware users can add recipients to their Campaigns in several ways, depending on their plan level:
Uploading a **CSV file**
**Manually** typing recipients into the recipient table
Importing from **Salesforce** (Enterprise plans only)
*(Gmail only)* Using the **“Add to Campaigns”** option from an email thread
### Uploading a CSV
You can upload a spreadsheet of recipients directly into a Campaign.
**Best practice:**Ensure that the **"email" column is first** in your CSV. All other column headers can be used for merge fields and personalization.
### Manually Typing into the Recipient Table
You can also add recipients one by one directly in the recipient table:
All column headers are editable
You can add rows or columns to include more data manually
### Gmail Only: "Add to Campaigns" from an Email Thread
In Gmail, hover over the **Yesware "Y" icon** next to an email address in a thread.
Select **“Add to Campaigns.”**
The Campaigns dashboard will open.
Choose the Campaign you'd like to add the recipient to.
### Salesforce Imports (Enterprise Plans)
Enterprise users can import recipients in multiple ways:
**Import a Contact or Lead List**Any list created in Salesforce will be available to import into Campaigns.
**Search Salesforce to Add an Individual**Use the search box to locate and add a single Contact or Lead.
**From a List View in Salesforce**Select the list view, then click **“Add to Campaign.”**Hover over the desired Campaign and click the blue **“Add Recipients”** button.
**From an Individual Contact/Lead Record**Open the record in Salesforce and click **“Add to Campaign.”**Then select the Campaign and use the **“Add Recipients”** button.
**Note:** Fields from your Salesforce list will appear as column headers and can be used for merge field personalization.
### Personalization Options
Once recipients are added, you can personalize their emails:
**At the time of adding recipients**:Click the **“Preview &amp; Personalize”** button.
**After the Campaign starts**:Go to **“Manage Recipients”**, select the recipient’s row, choose the desired Touch, and click **“Personalize Touch.”**
