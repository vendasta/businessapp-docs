# Is there a limit to how many recipients can be added into a Campaign?

On the Premium and Enterprise plans, Yesware's Campaigns feature has a limit of 900 recipients per upload ([click here for more info on how to add recipients](/docs/campaigns/managing-active-campaigns/how-can-i-add-recipients-to-a)) and a limit of 5000 recipients per campaign.Â  Our Pro Plan allows 20 recipients/month and our Free plan allows 10 recipients/month.
If you are currently on a Yesware trial, there will be a limit of 500 recipients for the duration of the trial.
This information applies to both Gmail and Outlook users.
