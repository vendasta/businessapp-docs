# BCC Campaigns To Salesforce

To set up BCC to Salesforce, follow these steps:
- In Gmail, click the **Yesware** drop-down menu in the top-left corner and select **Preferences**.
- Go to the **Integrations** section.
- Turn **"BCC to CRM"** to **ON**.
- Enter your unique BCC address.
- Click **Save &amp; Reload**.
- Ensure the **"CRM"** button is checked in your Gmail compose window.
**Please note:**
You will need to repeat this process every time you add new recipients to an existing campaign. However, there is a workaround: by adding the **BCC to the CRM** email address when you first create the campaign, it will automatically be included in all future communications for that campaign.
