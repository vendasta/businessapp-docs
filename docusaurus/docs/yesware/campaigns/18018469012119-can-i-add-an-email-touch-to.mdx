# Can I add an email touch to an active campaign?

At this time, you do not have the ability to add email touches to a campaign for recipients already in flight. The email touch would have to have been added** prior** to when you added the recipients and sent out the campaign.
However, this means that any** new recipients** added to the campaign, moving forward, will receive the new email touch.
For any recipients that won't receive the follow-up email touch, as a workaround, we suggest creating a single email touch campaign with the follow-up email touch that you wanted to send out and adding those recipients to the campaign.
