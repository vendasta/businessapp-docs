# How are monthly campaign recipient limits calculated?

Your Yesware subscription plan determines how many recipients you can add to campaigns each calendar month.
This monthly limit applies across *all* campaigns. For example, you could use 50% of your recipient allowance by sending **Campaign A** in the first week, and the remaining 50% with **Campaign B** later in the month.
The limit resets on the **first day of each month**.
