# Does Yesware offer bounced email reporting?

While we do not have a reporting feature that provides data and statistics on bounced emails in [**app.yesware.com,**](http://app.yesware.com/) you can still gather this information by exporting the bounced recipients for each campaign.
To get this, you will first need to filter the campaign recipients by those that bounced by clicking into the campaign, selecting the "**Recipients**" tab, setting the filter to "**Bounced**" &gt; clicking "**Apply.**"
From there you will then need to export these recipients by checking the box next to "**Personal Details**" &gt; "**Export.**"
