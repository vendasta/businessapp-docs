# Can I share my Campaigns?

Yes! You can share your Campaigns with other members of your Team. When you share a Campaign, your Team members will be able to **use the Campaign’s content**, but they **will not be able to access or manage your recipients**.
To share a Campaign:
Click on the Campaign you’d like to share.
Select **"Share"** in the bottom right.
Choose which Team(s) to share your Campaign with using the **Team picker**.
Any Campaigns submitted by **Team Leaders and Team Members** will appear in the Campaigns dashboard for all Team members to use immediately—though they may need to **refresh their inboxes** to see the update.
### Gmail
Users may need to **refresh their inbox** to see shared Campaigns.
### Outlook
