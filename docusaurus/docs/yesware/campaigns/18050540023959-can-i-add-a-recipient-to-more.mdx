# Can I add a recipient to more than one campaign?

### Can Gmail or Outlook users add more than one recipient in a campaign?
Currently, there is no ability to add the same email address onto more than one campaign at a time. If you would like to include a user on another campaign, you will need to manually remove them from the current campaign they are on, and move them to the new, desired campaign.
### Manually move a recipient to a new campaign
Click into the campaign &gt; "Recipients" tab &gt; check the box next to their email address &gt; 'Move To' button at the top of the page and select the new campaign.
