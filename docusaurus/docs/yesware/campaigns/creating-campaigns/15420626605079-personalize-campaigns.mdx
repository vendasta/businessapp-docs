# Personalize Campaigns

There is lots of room for personalization within a Campaign! You can:
Use **merge fields** to personalize emails using data from your CSV or Salesforce list
Add a **Personalization column** to the recipient table
Customize messages for individual recipients in **Preview &amp; Personalize**
Add tailored content even after launching a Campaign using **Manage Recipients**
*(Gmail only)* Add finishing touches in **Manual Email Touches**
### Merge Fields
Mapping merge fields from your **CSV or Salesforce list** to the compose area allows you to pull in personalization for each recipient. As long as the merge fields in the compose area match exactly with the column headers in the recipient table, the information will pull in correctly.
Use the **"Merge Field"** button at the bottom of the compose window to help enter the correct syntax, or use a Template that already includes corresponding fields.
*Note: Any fields used to build your list in Salesforce will appear as column headers when you import a Contact/Lead list.*
### Add Personalization Column to Recipient Table
If you're using a Salesforce import and want to go beyond basic fields like name or company, you can add a new column for personalized data—such as "Alma Mater" or "Industry Comment."
After importing your recipient list, click **"Add Column"** under the table.
Label the new column.
Enter your custom content per recipient.
Use the **"Insert Merge Field"** button to pull that new column into the email body.
### Preview &amp; Personalize
In the **Preview &amp; Personalize** area, you can tailor messaging for specific recipients before launch:
Find the recipient in the list.
Click their name to open their compose area.
Type your custom note.
Click **"Apply Personalization"** to save it.
### Important
Clicking **"Save and Exit"** only saves the content template for the touch—not added recipients.
If you add personalization without saving recipients, those notes will not be retained.
### Manage Recipients
Even after launching a Campaign, you can personalize messages on the fly:
Locate the Campaign and open the **More Actions kebab menu**.
Click **"Manage Recipients."**
Find the recipient, expand the relevant touch, and click **"Personalize Touch."**
Add your message and click **"Save Personalization."**
****
*If the email is scheduled to send immediately, you won’t be able to add content and will receive a warning.*
### Gmail Only: Manual Email Touch
If you're using a **Manual Email Touch** in Gmail, you can personalize the message just before hitting **Send**:
Add any custom notes directly in the compose window before sending—no need to go back into the Campaign builder.
