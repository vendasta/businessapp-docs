# What Is Yesware’s Campaigns Feature?

Yesware’s Campaigns feature enables you to create **multi-touch, multi-channel outreach sequences** directly from your inbox. It's similar to a mail merge—but with more powerful options like phone calls, LinkedIn tasks, and automated or manual email touches.
Campaigns help you and your team stay compliant with messaging guidelines while scaling your outreach efficiently. Whether you're prospecting, following up, or re-engaging leads, Campaigns keep you focused and organized by delivering a **prioritized, always-up-to-date to-do list** of your next steps, without leaving your inbox.
Campaigns can be tailored to match your workflow by:
Channel (email, call, LinkedIn task, etc.)
Touch frequency and spacing
Degree of automation (manual or automated)
For example, you might create a Campaign with:
An initial automated email
A LinkedIn connection request two days later
A phone call reminder on the fifth day
**Gmail Users:** Campaigns are built and managed directly from the Gmail interface via the Yesware add-on.
**Outlook Users:** Campaigns are accessed via the Add-ins section in your Outlook ribbon, and open in a standalone window for full functionality.
