# How do I send a Manual Email via Campaigns from Gmail?

One of the available [touch-types](/docs/general/what-touches-can-i-add-to-a) in [Campaigns](https://support.yesware.com/hc/en-us/articles/15420669475351-Set-up-multi-channel-Campaigns-from-your-inbox) for Gmail is a Manual email. Unlike an Automated email, a Manual email requires some human intervention to get it sent. You may consider using a Manual email instead of an Automated email if you want to add a personalized attachment, insert some extra notes of personalization, or simply give it a once-over before you send it out.
To take action on a Manual email, you must go to the [Campaigns tab of the Yesware sidebar](/docs/campaigns/creating-campaigns/how-do-i-access-my-to-do). If you've just added Manual tasks, don't forget to refresh the sidebar. From there, select the to-do card for your manual email and click "Email."  
This will pop out a compose window with the content you already created in the Campaign.  You can then add any finishing touches and click the "send" button.
