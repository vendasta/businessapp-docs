# Is there a maximum number of touches I can have in a Campaign?

**Is there a maximum number of touches I can have in a Campaign for either Gmail or Outlook users?**
There is no limit to the number of touches you include in a Campaign and you can mix and match your [touch types](/docs/general/what-touches-can-i-add-to-a) in any way that you see fit. We do recommend limiting your Campaigns to somewhere between 5 to 10 touches, but you can have as many as you think you need to accomplish your goal.
