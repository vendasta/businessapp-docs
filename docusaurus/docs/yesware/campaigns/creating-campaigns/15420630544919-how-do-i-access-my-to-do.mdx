# How do I access my to-do list for manual Campaign tasks in Gmail?

To take action on any of the [manual tasks](/docs/general/what-touches-can-i-add-to-a) of your Campaign, you'll need to access the Campaigns to-do list, located in the Yesware sidebar in your Gmail inbox. To get there, click on the Yesware logo from the right-hand side of your Gmail to enable the sidebar. Once enabled, you’ll see and select the Campaigns tab.
From the Campaigns to-do list, you can send [manual emails](/docs/campaigns/creating-campaigns/how-do-i-send-a-manual-email), complete [custom tasks](/docs/general/how-do-i-take-action-on-a), or log [phone calls](/docs/general/how-do-i-take-an-action-on).  For those using the [LinkedIn Sales Navigator integration](/docs/general/additional-resources/linkedin-sales-navigator), you also have the option to send a Connection or InMail.
