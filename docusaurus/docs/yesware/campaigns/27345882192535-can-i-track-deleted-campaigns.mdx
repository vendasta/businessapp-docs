# Can I Track Deleted Campaigns?

When a campaign is deleted from the dashboard, hereâ€™s what you need to know:
### What Happens When a Campaign is Deleted?
- **Permanent Deletion**: Once a campaign is deleted, it cannot be retrieved or restored in your account.
- **Email Tracking**: Emails that were sent as part of the deleted campaign will still be trackable, so you can monitor their performance.
- **Scheduled Touches**: Any remaining scheduled touches or emails associated with the campaign will no longer be sent, as the campaign is permanently removed.
