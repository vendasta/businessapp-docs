# Is there a way to stagger emails within a campaign?

Yesware Campaign sends emails about **10-15 seconds apart** when you send to a list of recipients. At this time, there is no way to alter this cadence.Â 
While it's a little more time-consuming, we typically recommend breaking up a large list into a few smaller ones and setting different send times for each batch when you add them to Campaigns.
