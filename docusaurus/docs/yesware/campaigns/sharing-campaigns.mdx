# Sharing Campaigns

## What is campaign sharing?

Campaign sharing allows you to share your campaign content with other members of your team. When you share a campaign, your team members can use the campaign's content, touches, and structure to add their own recipients and execute outreach. Each team member maintains control over their own recipients while leveraging the same campaign framework.

## Why is this important?

Sharing campaigns enables:

- Consistency across team outreach efforts
- Faster campaign deployment for team members
- Collaborative testing of messaging and sequences
- Team-wide performance tracking and optimization
- Best practice sharing across your organization

## What's included?

When you share a campaign:

- Team members can view and use the campaign content
- Each team member adds and manages their own recipients
- Recipients remain private to each user
- Team-wide performance metrics can be tracked
- Updates to the campaign structure are not automatically shared

## How to share a campaign

You can share your Campaigns with other members of your Team. When you share a Campaign, your Team members will be able to use the Campaign's content, but they will not be able to access or manage your recipients.

### Steps to share a campaign

1. Click on the Campaign you'd like to share.
2. Select `Share` in the bottom right.
3. Choose which Team(s) to share your Campaign with using the Team picker.

Any Campaigns submitted by Team Leaders and Team Members will appear in the Campaigns dashboard for all Team members to use immediately—though they may need to refresh their inboxes to see the update.

### Platform-specific considerations

**Gmail:** Users may need to refresh their inbox to see shared Campaigns.

**Outlook:** Users may need to refresh their inboxes to see shared Campaigns.

## How to use a shared campaign

Once a campaign has been shared with you:

1. Navigate to your Campaigns dashboard
2. Refresh your inbox if you don't see the shared campaign immediately
3. Select the shared campaign
4. Add your own recipients
5. Launch the campaign for your recipients

Your recipients will be separate from other team members' recipients, and you will only be able to view and manage your own.

## How to track team performance

To measure the success of a Shared Campaign across your Team:

1. Open the shared campaign
2. Toggle the `My Stats` button to `Campaign Stats`
3. This view will show the open, click, and connect percentages for your entire team on each shared Campaign

This allows you to:

- See aggregate performance across all team members using the campaign
- Compare your individual performance to team averages
- Identify high-performing campaigns for wider team adoption
- Make data-driven decisions about campaign optimization

## Additional functionality

### Team-level reporting

You can view Campaign performance at the user and team level by using the:

- **Campaigns by User Report:** See individual performance across all campaigns
- **Campaigns by Campaign Report:** See team-wide performance for specific campaigns

These reports allow you to:

- Sort by various engagement metrics
- Track recipient progression across campaigns
- Analyze meeting booking rates
- Customize date ranges for focused analysis

### Privacy and recipient management

It's important to understand recipient privacy when working with shared campaigns:

- Users cannot view the recipients of another team member's campaigns
- Each team member can only access the details of their own campaigns by navigating to the campaign and clicking on the `Recipients` section
- For privacy and security reasons, recipient information is kept confidential and is only visible to the account holder who added them
