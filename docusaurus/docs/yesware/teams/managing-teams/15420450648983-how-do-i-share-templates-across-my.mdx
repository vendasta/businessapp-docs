# How do I share Templates across my Team?

### Template Sharing for Gmail and Outlook Users
If you're a Team Leader on the Premium and Enterprise plans, you can create, share, or copy Templates into your Teams' folders. To share an existing Template:
- Navigate to the Template
- Select "Share with Team" button at the bottom of the page
- In the box that appears, select which Team and folder you'd like to save the Template
You'll also need to decide if you want to "share" or "duplicate &amp; share"
- Share - this selection removes the Template from your Templates and puts it into the Team folder.  Now, any Team member can view, edit, and use that Template.
- Duplicate &amp; Share - this selection keeps a copy of the Template in your folder but also creates a copy of the Template in the Team folder, which members can then view, edit, and use without changing your copy.
OR
- Navigate to the Template
- Select “More” in the bottom right
- Choose "Move Template"
- In the box that appears, switch from Personal to Team
- Then, select the Team and the folder to which you want to move the Template
- The Template will be shared with those Team members (Please note, if you "move" a Template from a Personal to a Shared folder, it will no longer be accessible in your folder)
To create a Template and share it with a Team at the time you create the Template:
- Click "New Template"
- As you are setting it up, in the "Save in Folder" section, select "Edit"
- Click "Team"
- Then, select the Team and folder you want to save the Template to
- Once you create and save the Template, it will be shared with those Team members and you will not have a Personal copy
Once a Template has been shared, individual Team members must refresh their Gmail inbox to have access to the Template.
Reordering Templates within a folder is accomplished by navigating to the folder and selecting the "Custom Sort" button in the upper left.  This will let you drag and drop Templates to get your desired order.  
Only Team Leaders can create or move templates into their Teams.
