# Where can I see the activities that Yesware has created in Salesforce?

Yesware email activity will sync as completed tasks in the **Activity History** on the Contact or Lead record with an email address that matches the email address where you sent the email. If your recipient has a Contact record (as opposed to a Lead record,) you can also see this activity on the Account record's Activity History, and if the Contact is assigned as a "[Contact Role](/docs/salesforce-integration/salesforce-sync-enterprise-plan/how-do-i-automatically-associate-my-email)" on an open Opportunity, you will see the activity on the Opportunity's Activity History as well.  
There are different activities that will generate tasks within Salesforce. These different activities can be identified by the Task subjects that Yesware logs.
**Message Sent: [subject of the email] **- generated when you send an email with Send to Salesforce turned on.
**Message Opened: [subject of the email]** - generated when your recipient opens an email that you originally sent with Send to Salesforce enabled.
**Link Clicked in Message: [subject of the email]** - generated when your recipient clicks on a tracked link within an email that you originally sent with Send to Salesforce enabled.
**Presentation Viewed: [subject of the email]** - generated when your recipient opens a tracked presentation with Send to Salesforce enabled.
**Reply: [subject of the email]** - generated when your recipient replies to an email that you originally sent with Send to Salesforce enabled.
### Salesforce Reporting
In addition to Yesware’s own reporting functionality, we’ve created a [Managed Package for Salesforce](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxListingDetail?listingId=a0N3A00000FMiIVUA1), that will add custom Yesware reports &amp; dashboards to the reporting dashboard in your Salesforce environment. These reports will give account managers and team leaders the ability to pull Yesware activity right from Salesforce, giving them valuable insight into rep activity and messaging success.
