# How Can I Ensure Tracked Email Events Are Displayed as "Email" Instead of "Call" in Salesforce?

Yesware logs activities to Salesforce using the **default value set for the "Activity Type" field** in your Salesforce environment. If your Salesforce is currently defaulting to “Call,” Yesware will follow that setting—even for email-related activity.
To ensure tracked emails are logged as **“Email”** instead of “Call,” you have two options:
**1. Change the Default Activity Type in Salesforce**
Ask your Salesforce Administrator to:
Navigate to:`Salesforce &gt; Setup &gt; Customize &gt; Activities &gt; Task Fields &gt; Activity Type`
Uncheck the default checkbox for **“Call”**
Optionally, set **“Email”** as the new default
This will ensure that new Yesware tasks default to “Email” rather than “Call.”
**2. Use a Workflow Rule or Field Update**
If you want more granular control, your Salesforce Admin can create a **workflow rule or field update** that:
Detects tasks created by Yesware (e.g., based on a Yesware-specific field or marker)
Automatically updates the **Activity Type** field to **“Email”** for those tasks
This option is useful if your team uses different defaults across departments or wants to automate the change without altering the global default.
