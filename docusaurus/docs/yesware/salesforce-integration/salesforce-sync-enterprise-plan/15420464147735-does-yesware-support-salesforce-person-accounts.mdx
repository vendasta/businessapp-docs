# Does Yesware support Salesforce Person Accounts?

Once Salesforce Sync is set up, Yesware will sync emails sent, replies received, and recipient engagement activities (such as opened messages, clicked links, and viewed presentations) to Salesforce Person Accounts.
In addition, we support creating Tasks, Events, and Logging Calls against Person Accounts and you can upload a CSV file with Person Accounts into Campaigns.
You can *view* Person Accounts in the Salesforce Sidebar but we do not support the ability to *edit* Person Accounts from the Salesforce/Campaigns Sidebar.
