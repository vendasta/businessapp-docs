# How many API calls does Yesware use?

Yesware uses **Salesforce API calls** any time it communicates with your Salesforce organization. This includes actions such as:
Using the **Salesforce Sidebar** to look up Accounts or Leads
Syncing **Yesware-tracked emails** into Salesforce
The number of API calls made depends on the action, and some activities may result in **multiple API calls**.
### Managing API Usage
If you only want specific types of activity (e.g., opens, link clicks) to sync into Salesforce, you can request to **disable selective event syncing**.
Your **Salesforce Admin** can monitor API call usage from within Salesforce.
If your organization reaches its API limit, your Admin can also request a **limit increase** directly from Salesforce.
