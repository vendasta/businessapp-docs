# How to Disable "Send to Salesforce" in Yesware

You can disable **Send to Salesforce** for individual emails directly from the compose window. This allows you to prevent a specific message from being logged in Salesforce while retaining tracking and template features. The process differs slightly between Gmail and Outlook.
**Important:** If your Yesware administrator has enabled a **Global Policy** enforcing automatic Salesforce sync, the toggle will be disabled and cannot be turned off.
### For Gmail
In the compose window, click the **Salesforce cloud icon** at the bottom.
Toggle **“Send to Salesforce”** to the **off** position.
### For Outlook
In the compose window, go to the **Yesware section of the ribbon**.
Click **“Open Sidebar.”**
Toggle **“Send to Salesforce”** to the **off** position.
### How to Permanently Disconnect from Salesforce
If you want to fully disconnect Yesware from Salesforce, you can do so by selecting **“Deauthorize”**:

This will prevent any further syncing between your Yesware account and Salesforce until reauthorized.
