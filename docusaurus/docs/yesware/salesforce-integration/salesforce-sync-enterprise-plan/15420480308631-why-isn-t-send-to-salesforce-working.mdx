# Why isn't Send to Salesforce working?

If your emails aren’t syncing to Salesforce automatically, there are several possible causes. Follow the steps below to make sure everything is correctly configured and your connection is active.
### 1. Make Sure Send to Salesforce Is Enabled
**For Gmail:**
Click the **Yesware menu** at the top of Gmail.
Select **Preferences**.
Navigate to the **Integrations** section.
Under **Salesforce**, toggle **Send to Salesforce** to the **On** position.
If not already authenticated, click to **authenticate your Salesforce account**.
Click **Save &amp; Reload**.
**For Outlook:**
In the **Yesware Sidebar**, click **Authenticate with Salesforce**.
Log in to Salesforce if prompted, then click **Accept**.
Open a compose window.
In the Yesware section of the ribbon, click **Open Sidebar**.
Toggle **“Sync Email to Salesforce”** to the **On** position.
### 2. Reauthorize Your Salesforce Connection
If Send to Salesforce is enabled but still not syncing:
Go to **Salesforce Preferences** on the Yesware web app.
Click **Deauthorize** next to where it says "Authenticated for Salesforce user: [your email address]".
Then click **Authorize** again to re-link your account.
This often refreshes your connection and resolves syncing issues.
### 3. Check API Access in Salesforce
If problems persist, contact your Salesforce Administrator to confirm that your **user profile has API access enabled**. Without this, Yesware cannot sync data to your Salesforce account.
### 4. Understand Sync Limitations
Keep in mind that Yesware will **not** sync emails to Salesforce if:
The recipient has the **same domain** as your email address (e.g., internal emails).
The recipient **does not have a Contact or Lead record** in Salesforce.
### 5. Still Need Help?
If you've verified all settings and you're still having trouble please reach out to Yesware Support.
