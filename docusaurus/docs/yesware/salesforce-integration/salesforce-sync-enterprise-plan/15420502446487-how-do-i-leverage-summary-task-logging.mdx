# How do I leverage Summary-Task Logging?

### How to leverage Summary-Task logging as a Gmail or Outlook user
### Overview
Yesware ensures Salesforce is always up to date by logging emails, replies, and all relevant email engagement data as Tasks in Salesforce.
**By default**, Yesware will create a new Task for each type of activity that happens on an email:
**Send:** User sends an outbound email
**Open:** Recipient opens email
**Reply:** Recipient replies to email
**Click:** Recipient clicks link in email
**File:** Recipient opens attachment in email
**View:** Recipient views linked presentation
**Bounce:** Bounce reply received in response
Though we are careful not to create a new Task for every single open, click, etc., some may perceive this to be a cluttered view of tasks in Salesforce Activity History. With Summary Task-Logging, Yesware offers the option to **consolidate all of this activity down to a single Salesforce Task per sent email**. This single Task contains summarized data fields for all the activity that occurs on that email. Summary Task-Logging also allows the flexibility to continue to sync opens, replies, clicks, and bounces as separate tasks if you so choose.
### Activating Summary Task-Logging
To enable Summary Task-Logging:
1) Download this Yesware Salesforce package ([Sandbox, Production](https://test.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=04t0W0000019njv))
2) Add the new custom fields to your Task Page Layout in order to see the new fields appear on each send Task
3) Then contact your Yesware Account Manager, if you have one, or support@yesware.com to activate the Summary Task-Logging feature
When activating Summary Task-Logging, you can choose to leave Detailed Task-Logging (the default of separating the tasks) on for any type of email activity you'd like. A typical approach for many customers is to activate Summary Task-Logging, and also leave Detailed Task-Logging enabled for Replies, but to deactivate Detailed Task-Logging for all other activities.
### FAQs
**Does this package break my current reports or views?**
Installing this package will not affect the core operation of existing reports or forms, however, deactivated Detailed Task-Logging will affect the output of those reports. The main function of Summarized Task-Logging is to create fewer tasks, and instead append information to an original sent message task. If you have a report that expects message opens, clicks, views, etc. to be represented by separate tasks, those reports will show different results when Detailed Task-Logging has been deactivated. Note that you can leave one or more Detailed Task-Logging features enabled even when you've activated Summary Task-Logging
**How do I see the new Summary Task-Logging fields? I’ve already installed the package.**
After installing the package, add the new custom fields to your Task Page Layout in order to see the new fields appear on each Send Task. These fields need to be visible on the layout for every user logging Yesware activity in Salesforce.
**Does this decrease the # of API calls relative to Detailed Task-Logging?**
The number of API calls will remain approximately the same; however, Summary Task-Logging is expected to reduce Salesforce data storage requirements.
**Do I have to disable Detailed Task-Logging to enable Summary Task-Logging?**
No. When activating Summary Task-Logging You can also choose to leave Detailed Task-Logging on for any type of email activities you'd like. A typical approach for many customers is to activate Summary Task-Logging, and also leave Detailed Task-Logging enabled for Replies, but to deactivate Detailed Task-Logging for all other activities.
**Will this reduce my available custom fields on Activities?**
Installing the Yesware managed package will reduce your [available custom fields](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=faq_distribution_installing_why_do_the_custom.htm&amp;language=en_US&amp;type=0). Please contact Salesforce to request an increased custom field limit.
### Appendix
**Yesware Task Custom Field Reference**
After you install this package, the following custom fields will be available on the Task object. These fields are used by Yesware for capturing summary data on logged emails.
For the different types of action, these fields capture the date of the first occurrence, the date of the most recent occurrence, and the number of occurrences in sum. For example, for an email that was sent on 2/1/2021, then opened 3 times, on 2/2/2021, 2/3/2021 and 2/4/2021, the field “Yesware Opens” will have the value of 3, the field “Yesware First Open At” will have a value of “2/2/2021” and field of “Yesware Last Open At” will have a value of “2/4/2021.”
**SF Task Page Layout**
In order to visualize the data in the custom fields, the SF page layout for the Task object must be modified to include the fields. There are two ways to achieve this -- either by assigning the page layout included in the managed package to the SF profiles that will need to see the custom fields, or by manually editing the Task object Page Layout and adding the custom fields manually.
Both of these can be done via the ‘Task Page Layouts’ page in the Setup app as shown below:
1. In the SF page at the upper right, click “Setup”:
2. In the left-side base, click “Customize:
3. Go to “Activities”, “Task Page Layouts”:
**SF Task Page Layout Setup using the “Yesware Sample Task Layout”**
To assign the sample page layout to a set of profiles, follow the steps below. Note that doing so will override any existing customizations on the Task Page Layout. If you have existing customizations to the Task Page Layout, please follow the instructions for manually editing the page layout in the section below.
1. Click ‘Page Layout Assignment’
2. Click ‘Edit Assignment’
3. Select the profiles to assign the new page layout to (Use SHIFT + click or click and drag to select a range of adjacent cells. Use CTRL + click to select multiple cells that are not adjacent).
4. Select ‘Yesware Sample Task Layout’ from the ‘Page Layout to Use’ dropdown.
5. Click ‘Save’.
**SF Task Page Layout Setup using manual page layout update**
To manually modify your Task page layout follow these steps after opening the ‘Task Page Layouts’ page:
1. Click “Edit” next to the page layout you would like to add the custom fields to:
2. This brings you to a page where the form layout for displaying a Task can be modified. In the section labelled “Task Layout,” all the available fields are shown. In the screenshot below one of the custom fields is indicated by the red outline.
To make the fields visible in the layout, use the cursor to click-drag a field down the Task Detail area. Ideally, you want to arrange the fields so they can be viewed easily, for example, all the total-count fields at the top and then the First-At and Last-At fields below.
3. When complete, the “Task Detail” area should look something like this:
4. Go back to the top of the page and click “Save” just under “Task Layout”.
### **End-to-End Example**
After this is done, the basic summary-logging works as follows:
1. Compose an email to a Contact. Include a link, file, and presentation. Send.
2. In a short while, the sent email will sync to your SFDC org. One way to see them is to make a custom report that shows all Tasks. Example:
3. Here’s what that task initially looks like:
4. Have the recipient open the mail, click the link, and view the presentation. The task will now show like so:
5. Note that the description will get updated with each additional action that is summarized, for example:
