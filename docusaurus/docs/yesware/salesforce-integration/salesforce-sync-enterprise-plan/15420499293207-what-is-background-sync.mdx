# What is Background Sync?

**Background sync is available to both Gmail and Outlook users on the Enterprise tier.**
With** Background Sync,** you can send a message *(from your email address linked to Yesware)* to any Contact or Lead in Salesforce, and we’ll make sure the message gets synced, whether you're at home or on the go. **Please note **that the Salesforce integration is only available on our Enterprise plan.
With Background Sync enabled for your account, we will scan your email and sync relevant emails to Salesforce.
When you send a message from a browser or Gmail account without Yesware enabled (like a home computer or mobile device), we will sync the message so long as it is being sent to an existing ***Contact** *or ***Lead** *in Salesforce.
Account Managers will be able to enable this feature under ***Global Policies***.
**NOTE:** If you don't have Background Sync enabled, we will still sync if the message is sent from a browser or Gmail account where Yesware is enabled, so long as your Send to Salesforce preference is enabled. Background Sync simply allows you to sync an email sent from a browser or Gmail account *without* Yesware enabled.
