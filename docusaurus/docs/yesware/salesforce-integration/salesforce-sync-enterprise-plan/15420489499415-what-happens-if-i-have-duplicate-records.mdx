# What happens if I have duplicate records with the same email address?

**What happens if I have duplicate records with the same email address when sending an email from Outlook or Gmail?**
We choose a single Contact or Lead and optionally a single Account or Opportunity.
**First, we pick who to associate the email with:**
We will sync the email with the first email address in the recipient list that has an associated Salesforce record, Contact or Lead.
**If**** there are duplicate Contacts/Leads in Salesforce with that email address:**
- Prefer Leads over Contacts (Please note, certain Yesware customizations can alter this behavior)- Prefer Contacts with Open Opportunities over Contacts with no Open Opportunity- Prefer Contacts/Leads with the most recent activity, including updates, if all other things are equal
**Once we’ve selected who to associate with, then we pick what to associate with:**- Prefer to associate with an Open Opportunity for the selected Contact, provided that the Contact is assigned as a [Contact Role.](/docs/salesforce-integration/salesforce-sync-enterprise-plan/how-do-i-automatically-associate-my-email)- If not, associate with an Account for the selected Contact
