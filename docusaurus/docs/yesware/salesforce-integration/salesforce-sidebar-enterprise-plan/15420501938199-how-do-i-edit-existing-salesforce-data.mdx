# How Do I Edit Existing Salesforce Data from the Sidebar?

You can easily edit Salesforce Contact, Lead, or Account data directly from the Yesware Salesforce Sidebar in your inbox. All changes made through the Sidebar are saved and reflected in your Salesforce environment.
**1. Locate the record you want to edit**
Use the **search bar** at the top of the Salesforce Sidebar to find a Contact or Lead by typing their name or email address.
If there’s only one match, you’ll be taken directly to their record.
If multiple results appear, choose the correct record from the list.
If you're viewing an email from or to the person, their Contact or Lead page will automatically display in the Sidebar—no search needed.
**2. Edit Contact or Lead information**
Click the **“Edit”** button at the bottom left of the Sidebar.
Update any necessary fields.
Click **“Save”** to apply changes to Salesforce.
**3. Edit Account-level details (if needed)**
From the Contact page, click on the **Account Name** to open the associated Account record.
Click **“Edit”** to update Account-level fields, then **Save**.
This makes it quick and easy to update Salesforce records without leaving your inbox.
