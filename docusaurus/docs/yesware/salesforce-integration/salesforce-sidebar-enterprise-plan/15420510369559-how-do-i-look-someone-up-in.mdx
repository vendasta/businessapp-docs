# How do I look someone up in the Yesware Sidebar?

To look up a Contact or Lead, type their email address or name in the search bar at the top of the Yesware Salesforce Sidebar. If there is only one option, it will bring you directly to that individual's Contact/Lead record. If there are multiple options, select in the list the one you'd like to view and that will bring you to their Contact/Lead record.
