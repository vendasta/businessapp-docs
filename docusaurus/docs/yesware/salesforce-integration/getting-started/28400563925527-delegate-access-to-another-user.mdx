# Delegate Access To Another User

If you delegate access to your email account, Yesware tracking may not function as expected. Hereâ€™s an explanation of how delegation impacts tracking and best practices to ensure full functionality.
### Delegated Access
When email access is delegated to another user, certain limitations apply:
**Tracking Limitations:** Emails sent on behalf of the original account owner by someone with delegated access cannot be tracked by Yesware.
**Unique Login Credentials Required:** The email address used for sending tracked emails must have its own unique password and login credentials.
**Incompatibility with Aliases:** Aliases, "Send As" addresses, or emails accessed via delegation are not compatible with Yesware tracking.
### Shared Credentials
If the account owner shares their email login credentials with another user:
The other individual can use Yesware to send tracked emails from the account.
### Best Practices for Email Tracking
To ensure Yesware tracking works correctly:
Use a standalone email account with unique login credentials for all tracked emails.
Avoid using delegated access, aliases, or shared credentials if you require email tracking.
