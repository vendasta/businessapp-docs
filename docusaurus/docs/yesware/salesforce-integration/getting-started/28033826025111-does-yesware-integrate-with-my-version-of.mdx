# Does Yesware integrate with my version of Salesforce?

Yesware’s automatic Salesforce sync feature, available on our Enterprise plan, requires API integration. Here’s how to determine if your version of Salesforce supports this integration:
### Salesforce Editions Compatible with Yesware
**Enterprise Edition**: Includes API integration by default.
**Unlimited Edition**: Includes API integration by default.
If you are using the **Group** or **Professional** editions of Salesforce, you will need to contact Salesforce to request access to the API integration. Note that this may incur an additional cost.
### Non-Compatible Versions
Yesware is not compatible with the **Non-Profit** version of Salesforce. This is because the Non-Profit version does not utilize the "Contact" and "Lead" objects, which are necessary for integration.
For further questions about integrating Yesware with Salesforce, please contact our support team or refer to Salesforce’s API documentation for additional details.
