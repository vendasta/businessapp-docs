# Using Yesware with Salesforce SSO (Single Sign-On)

If your **Salesforce environment uses SSO (Single Sign-On)** and does **not require a password**, Yesware cannot authenticate using the standard login flow.
To integrate Yesware with a Salesforce account that uses SSO:
On the **Salesforce login screen**, click **“Use Custom Domain.”**
Enter your company’s custom domain and proceed with your usual SSO login flow.
This will allow Yesware to complete the authentication process securely.
For step-by-step instructions, follow this [Salesforce SSO login guide.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S1BNlk4IIAwtNOXl1eYh2wfVuZDUT2b9P5trUhj-2iI/edit?tab=t.0)
