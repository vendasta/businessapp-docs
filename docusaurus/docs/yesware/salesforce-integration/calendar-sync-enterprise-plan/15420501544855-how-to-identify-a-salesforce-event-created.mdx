# How to Identify a Salesforce Event Created Through Calendar Sync

Yesware automatically syncs meetings from your calendar to Salesforce, linking them with relevant records for streamlined tracking. Here's how to identify synced events and understand where they appear in Salesforce.
### Event Association
Yesware will automatically sync the meeting with the **Contact or Lead in Salesforce** associated with the **first email address** added as a guest to the calendar invite.
#### For Gmail
You can also manually select a Contact, Lead, Account, or Opportunity to associate the meeting with in Salesforce.
### Where Events Appear in Salesforce
The synced meeting will appear under **"Open Events"** for the corresponding Salesforce record until the scheduled meeting date and time has passed. After that, it will be listed under **"Activity History."**
If no matching record is found and no manual association is made, the event will still sync to Salesforce but **without an associated Contact/Lead or Account/Opportunity.**
****
### Event Notation
All events that Yesware logs into Salesforce using Calendar Sync will include the tag **"[event synced]"** in the **Description field** of the event **in Salesforce only**.
This notation is **not visible in your calendar application.**
For Gmail users: it will not appear in your **Google Calendar event**.
For Outlook users: it will not appear in your **O365 Calendar event**.
