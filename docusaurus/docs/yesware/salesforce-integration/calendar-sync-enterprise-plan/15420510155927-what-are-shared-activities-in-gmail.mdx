# What are Shared Activities in Gmail?

Shared Activities in Gmail is a Salesforce setting which allows users to relate up to 50 Contacts (but only 1 Lead) to an Event or a Task.
If you have Shared Activities enabled in Salesforce and are using Contacts, you can sync the Google Calendar meeting to more than one Contact in Salesforce.
Shared Activities would need to be enabled by *your* Salesforce administrator in Salesforce. Once enabled, please reach out to our Support Team using the "Submit a Request" option in the top right of this page to turn on Shared Activities for your Yesware Account's Calendar Sync.
