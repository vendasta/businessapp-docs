# How do I use Yesware Calendar Sync in Gmail?

Yesware's **Calendar Sync** feature eliminates manual data entry by syncing your **Google Calendar events directly to Salesforce**. It improves collaboration, simplifies meeting tracking, and helps keep your CRM up to date—without leaving your inbox.
**Note**: Calendar Sync is only available to users on the **Enterprise plan**.
### What Is Calendar Sync?
Calendar Sync automatically logs meetings to the appropriate Contact, Lead, Account, or Opportunity in Salesforce. By default, Yesware associates the event with the **first guest’s email address** in your invite, but you can manually change the associated records.
Events appear in the **Open Activities** section of the related Salesforce record until the meeting date/time passes, after which they move to **Activity History**. If no match is found, and no record is manually selected, the event is logged without an associated Contact or Account.
You can sync **events up to 30 days in the past** and any **future events**.
### How to Enable Calendar Sync
Visit your **Salesforce configuration page** in your Yesware account.
Toggle **Enable Yesware Calendar Sync**.
You can return to this page at any time to **disable** the feature.
Make sure you’re using the **latest version of the Yesware Gmail extension** with all permissions enabled.
### How to Sync a Google Calendar Event to Salesforce
**Open Google Calendar** and create a new event.
Toggle on **“Sync Calendar Event to Salesforce.”**
Add guests:
Use the **“Add Guests From Salesforce”** box,
or add guests manually via Google Calendar's native "Add guests" field.
Use the **Contact/Lead** and **Account/Opportunity** dropdowns to confirm or modify which Salesforce records the event is related to.
By default, Yesware will select the **first Contact/Lead** added to the guest list.
You can also choose to relate the event without adding them as a guest.
Click **Save** in the top-right corner to complete.
If **Shared Activities** is enabled in Salesforce, you can relate the meeting to multiple Contacts.
### Editing or Syncing Existing Events
To **edit an event** before it syncs:
Open the calendar event.
Make your changes.
Click **Save** (you do not need to click “Send”).
To **sync an inbound event**:
Open the event.
Make sure Calendar Sync is toggled **on**.
Confirm or update the associated records.
Click **Save**.
Any edits made to already synced events will automatically update in Salesforce.
### Two-Way Sync (Salesforce to Google Calendar)
To sync calendar events **from Salesforce to Google Calendar**, your Salesforce administrator must install a Salesforce package. This functionality is not included by default.
To request the package:
Click **“Submit a request”** at the top-right corner of this Help Center page.
A Yesware Support representative will provide the installation details.
