# Can I sync recurring events in Gmail?

**Yesware supports syncing recurring events.**
When syncing repeated events from Google Calendar to Salesforce, you should be aware that Salesforce (as of the Spring '15 release) imposes limits on the number of times an Event may repeat. Google Calendar, on the other hand, imposes no such limit and allows an Event to repeat indefinitely. The Salesforce limits are based on the number of recurrences (not calendar date) and vary depending on the recurrence frequency. For example, if you have a daily event, we will sync up to a year's worth of events into Salesforce.
