# How to add an non-US telephone number to a Yesware Contact

In Contacts, if you would like to add a non-US-based telephone number you can by using the formatting below. 
If entering + country code, the rest of the number, and it’s a valid International number this is supported. We use Google's phone validation library to validate these numbers.
- Example of the format: **+111 (11) 111 1111**
- Numbers starting with 0 is always a local dialling indicator and the Google phone library doesn’t support these numbers.
