# How do I edit a Yesware Contact?

### How do I edit a Yesware Contact in Gmail?
In Gmail, you can edit Yesware contacts in your Contacts Sidebar. To do so, you'll want to open an email with a contact or search for a contact at the top of the sidebar. Once the profile pops up in the sidebar, you can click the pencil icon next to any of the fields to update the information. Once you make the edit, click **Enter** to save the updated information.
In the [App Site](https://app.yesware.com/contacts/list), you can select a specific contact or search for the contact you'd like to update. From there, you can click on any information associated with the contact and click enter to save. 
### How do I edit a Yesware Contact in Outlook?
Once a contact is created, you can edit the information to make sure it stays relevant. Within the [app site](https://app.yesware.com/contacts), you can select a specific contact or search for the contact you'd like to update. From there, you can click on any information associated with the contact and click enter to save.  
This will allow you to go into the contacts as you notice changes in title and contact information. Under the contacts, you can add notes on the right hand side of the Contacts page. This will allow you to keep updated notes so you always know the latest update as you prep for meetings with the contact.
