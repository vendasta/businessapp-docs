# How do I delete a Yesware Contact?

Yesware’s Contact feature automatically creates a new Contact for each recipient you email. If you want to remove a Contact from your Yesware account, you can do so from the **Contacts page on the Yesware app site**:
Go to the **Contacts page**.
Search for and select the Contact you’d like to delete.
Click **"Delete"** in the top right corner of the Contact page.
A confirmation message will appear—click **"Delete Contact"** to confirm.
### **Gmail**
You can also delete a Contact directly from Gmail:
Open the **Contacts Sidebar**.
Search for a specific Contact or open an email from them to bring up their record.
At the bottom of the sidebar, click **"Delete Contact Record."**
Confirm by clicking **"Delete Contact"** in the popup.
