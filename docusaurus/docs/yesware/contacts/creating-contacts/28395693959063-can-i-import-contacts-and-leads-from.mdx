# Can I Import Contacts and Leads from Salesforce Campaigns into Yesware?

No, Yesware Campaigns does not currently support importing data directly from the Salesforce Campaigns object.
### What Can Be Imported into Yesware Campaigns?
Users can import **Contact** and **Lead** records from Salesforce into Yesware Campaigns. However, other Salesforce objects, including those within the Campaigns object, are not supported for import.
### Workaround Options
If you need to use data from the Salesforce Campaigns object, consider these steps:
**Export the Campaign Data:** Use Salesforce’s export tools to extract the data from the Campaigns object.
**Format the Data:** Ensure the exported data is formatted correctly for upload into Yesware as Contact or Lead records.
**Import into Yesware:** Follow Yesware’s standard process to import Contact or Lead data into your campaign.
