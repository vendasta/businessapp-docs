# How to Create a New Yesware Contact

Yesware automatically creates a **Contact page** for every new recipient you email. However, you can also manually add Contacts if needed—useful when someone isn’t automatically tagged or when you want to pre-fill information in advance.
### For Gmail
In the **Yesware Sidebar**, click the **Add (+) icon** in the top-right corner. 
Enter the **email address** (required).
Optionally add additional details:
First Name
Last Name
Company
Title
Phone Number
Click **Create** to save the Contact.
****
### For Outlook
Go to the **Contacts page** in the Yesware web app.
Click **“New Contact”** in the top-right corner.
Fill in the required **Email** field.
Optionally add:
Name
Company
Title
Phone Number
Notes
Click **Create** to save the Contact.
You can return to the Contact later to **edit or update** any information as needed.
