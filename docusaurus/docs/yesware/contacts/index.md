# Getting Started with Contacts

## What is Contacts?

Contacts is your inbox's integrated address book. It allows you to view contact profiles, track past interactions, add recipients to Campaigns, and record and review internal notes—all from within your email workflow.

Contacts are created automatically when you send or receive emails. You can also create them manually to pre-fill information or add contacts before initiating outreach.

## Why is this important?

Having a centralized contact management system within your email platform helps you:

- Keep all contact information organized and up to date
- Access interaction history quickly when preparing for meetings or follow-ups
- Add context through internal notes that stay with each contact
- Streamline your outreach by adding contacts directly to Campaigns
- Enrich contact profiles with additional professional data

## What's included?

Contacts provides several key capabilities:

- **Automatic Contact Creation**: A contact record is created for any recipient you email using Gmail or Outlook
- **Manual Contact Creation**: Add contacts manually when needed
- **Contact Profiles**: View and edit contact details including name, email, company, title, and phone number
- **Interaction Timeline**: See a full timeline of emails sent, replies received, and meetings booked
- **Internal Notes**: Add and save notes for each contact
- **Contact Enrichment**: Retrieve additional professional and company data (add-on feature)
- **Quick Actions**: Start Campaigns or compose emails directly from contact profiles

## How to access Contacts

### Using Contacts on the App Site (Gmail and Outlook)

You can access Contacts through the Yesware web app:

1. Go to [app.yesware.com](https://app.yesware.com) and click the `Contacts` tab.

When viewing an email, the sidebar will auto-load the associated contact profile, allowing you to see their timeline and add notes as needed.

### Using Contacts in Outlook

Outlook users access Contacts through the Yesware web app:

1. Go to the `Contacts` page in the Yesware web app.
2. Search for and select a specific contact or create a new one using the `New Contact` button.
