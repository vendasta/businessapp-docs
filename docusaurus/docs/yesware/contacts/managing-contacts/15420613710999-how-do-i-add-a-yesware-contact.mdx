# How Do I Add a Yesware Contact? (App Site)

On the [Contacts page](https://app.yesware.com/contacts) in the app site, you can also click on the Campaign button within the Contact to launch the Campaign screen in the app site. From there, select the Campaign you'd like to add the Recipient to. You'll be able to edit any information in the add recipient screen &amp; Campaign. The information that pulls through is the information that is available in the Contacts sidebar. We recommend previewing the Campaign to make sure your merge fields are set up correctly with the Contact information.
