# What is Contact Enrichment?

Yesware’s **Contact Enrichment** feature gives you instant access to up-to-date information about the prospects and customers you're engaging with, right from your inbox or the Yesware web app.
Whenever you email someone, Yesware automatically creates a Contact record. You can then enrich that Contact to retrieve additional professional and company data, helping you personalize outreach and understand who you're contacting.
**Note:** Contact Enrichment is an **add-on** to your existing Yesware plan and uses **enrichment credits**. Each enrichment uses **one credit**.
**Enriching Contacts in the Yesware App Site (Gmail &amp; Outlook)**
Go to the **Contacts page** in the Yesware web app.
Find the Contact you want to enrich.
Click **“Enrich Data”** on the right side of the Contact record.
The system will display both the existing profile and newly enriched information.
Click **“Save”** to update the Contact with the enriched details.
**Enriching Contacts in Gmail (Gmail-only)**
Open the **Yesware Contacts Sidebar** inside Gmail.
Select a Contact.
Click the **“Enrich Data”** button.
A credit will be used, and additional details will appear alongside the existing Contact data.
Click **“Save”** to update the Contact.
This feature helps you keep your records complete and up to date, without manual research.
