# How Do I Add a Yesware Contact? (Gmail)

From your Contacts tab on your sidebar, under 'Quick Actions,' you can find the "Campaigns" and "Email" buttons. If you click on the Campaign button, it'll open the Campaigns screen within Gmail. From there, select the Campaign you'd like to add the Recipient to. You'll be able to edit any information in the add recipient screen &amp; Campaign. The information that pulls through is the information that is available in the Contacts sidebar. We recommend previewing the Campaign to make sure your merge fields are set up correctly with the Contact information.Â 
In the Contacts page in the app site, you can also click on the Campaign button within the Contact to launch the Campaign screen in the app site. This will allow you to select, edit, and add the Contact to one of your Yesware Campaigns.
