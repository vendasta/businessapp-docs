# Which Contacts Will Show in Yesware Contacts?

Yesware automatically creates a Contact record for **any recipient you email** using your Gmail or Outlook inbox. This ensures that your outreach history, enrichment options, and engagement data are always tied to an up-to-date Contact profile.
### How Contacts are created
**Gmail**: A Contact is created in the **Yesware Sidebar** after you send an email to a new recipient.
**Outlook**: A Contact is created in the **Contacts page** of the Yesware web app after an email is sent.
### Creating a Contact manually
**Gmail**: Click the **“+” icon** at the top of the Contacts Sidebar to create a new Contact manually.
**Outlook**: Click **“New Contact”** at the top right of the Contacts page in the Yesware web app.
### What you can do with a Contact
Once a Contact is created, you can:
Edit the Contact’s information
Add internal notes
Enrich the Contact with additional data (if you have enrichment credits)
Delete the Contact if needed
View a timeline of messages exchanged with that Contact
This functionality ensures that your contact list stays current and actionable—without requiring manual upkeep for every email you send.
