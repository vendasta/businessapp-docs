# What Data is Shown on the Recipient Engagement Report?

The [Recipient Engagement Report](https://app.yesware.com/reports/recipient/#/recipient) shows you how each of your individual recipients is engaging with your tracked emails, so you can base your follow-up on who is engaging and who isn’t. It will show you the total number of tracked emails that have been engaged with (opened, link clicked, or attachment viewed) by a specific recipient within the selected time period. Emails sent *without* engagement within the selected period are omitted from this tally.
The report is broken down recipient-by-recipient and can be sorted by recipient, number of engaged emails, number of email opens, number of link clicks, number of attachment views, and date of the most recent engagement. Choose from a variety of date ranges to see which of your recipients are the most engaged and which need extra attention.
Click "Download Report" to export to CSV the data contained in the table. Feel free to customize the data to your needs before downloading to ensure you're only exporting the information you want.
