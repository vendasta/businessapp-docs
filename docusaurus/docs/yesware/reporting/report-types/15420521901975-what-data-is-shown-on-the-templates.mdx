# What Data is Shown on the Templates Report by Template?

The [Templates Report by Template](https://app.yesware.com/reports/templates/#/templates/by_template) provides an overview of the usage and performance of specific, individual personal and team Templates. The report breaks down Template usage by each Template, so sales leaders can guide their team strategy and individual team members can see which Templates their colleagues might be using successfully. It shows the name of the unique Templates sent, the number of tracked emails sent with that Template inserted, the percentage of those tracked emails that are opened, and the percentage that receive a reply. This information can be [easily sorted](/docs/reporting/report-types/how-do-i-filter-in-the-email) and [reporting periods can be specified](/docs/reporting/report-types/how-can-i-filter-by-date-range) for more deliberate searching.
The report includes when the data was last refreshed, as well as the following metrics:
**Template-** The name of each unique Template.
**Users -** The total number of users who sent tracked emails that included that individual Template.
**Open Percentage Rate -** Of all tracked emails that included that individual Template, the percent of messages that received at least one open.
**Reply Percentage Rate -** Of all tracked emails that included that individual Template, the percent of messages that received at least one reply.
