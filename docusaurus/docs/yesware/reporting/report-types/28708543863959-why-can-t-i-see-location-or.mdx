# Why can't I see location or device data in the tracking information?

For multiple-recipient emails, all Open and Engagement information will be consolidated under the recipient specified in the "TO" section of the outreach email.
Any available location information will be displayed in your Activity Feed as well as in your [**Personal Tracking Report**](http://app.yesware.com/reports/tracking).
