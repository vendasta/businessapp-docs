# How Do I Filter In the Email Activity and Templates Reports?

### Email Activity Report
When looking at your email activity data in the [Email Activity Report,](https://app.yesware.com/reports/activity/#/activity) you have the option to manipulate the data to see all data pertaining to your own tracked email activity, as well as that of your teammates. View sent, open, and reply rates for both you and your teammates and sort by reporting period, team, and metric to learn as much as you can so that you and your teammates can improve together. *Please note, this report includes both tracked and untracked messages.*
In addition to filtering and sorting by date ("Reporting period"), group of users on a specific team ("Filter users by"), and metric ("Sort by"), we also offer Advanced filters to help you include or exclude certain data points.
- By default, we *include* your own data in the reporting, however, some managers find it helpful to exclude their own data. To do so, click the "Advanced filters" button and select the check box to exclude "My Data." You will not see your name in the table or in the summary at the top. In addition, your stats will not be included in the all-teams average.
- Want to exclude users without *any* email activity? Simply select the "Advanced filters" option and check the box to exclude "Users Without Activity." You will not see in the table the name(s) of users who haven't sent any emails in the period selected.
- By default, we *exclude *emails sent to colleagues (colleague emails refer to emails sent to people with the same domain as you) from the data, however, if you'd like to include those emails and events, select the check box to include "Colleague Emails." The emails sent and emails tracked will then include emails sent to only colleagues, increasing the numbers in the table. In addition, the open percent and reply percent will include colleague opens and replies.
### Templates Reports (By User and By Template)
The [Template Reports](https://app.yesware.com/reports/templates/#/templates/by_user) give you the ability to view all data pertaining to your and your teammate's Template use, including sent, open, and reply rates. Sort by reporting period, team, and metric to learn as much as you can about Template use so that you and your teammates can improve together. Like the Email Activity Report, in the Templates Report **by User**, you will see your overall performance stats and those of your teammates at the top of the report, giving you quick and profound insight into how your Templates are performing and where there’s room for improvement. In the Templates Report **by Template**, you will be able to determine which Templates are most successful and which could use a little work. *Please note, these reports include both Personal and Team Templates, but only those sent in tracked messages.*
In addition to filtering and sorting by date ("Reporting period"), group of users on a specific team ("Filter users and data by,") and metric ("Sort by,") we also offer Advanced filters to help you include or exclude certain data points.
- By default, we *include* your own data in the reporting, however, some managers find it helpful to exclude their own data. To do so, click the "Advanced filters" button and select the check box to exclude "My Data."
- On the Templates Report **by User**, want to exclude users without *any* Template activity?  Simply select the "Advanced filters" option and check the box to exclude "Users Without Activity." 
- On the Templates Report **by Template**, prefer to exclude Templates that haven't been used?  Select the "Advanced filters" option and check the box to exclude "Templates Without Activity."
- By default, we are *including* in the reports all the Templates you have in your Personal folders and all the Templates that your teammates have in their Personal folders, as well as Team Templates. If you'd prefer only to look at the data for shared Team Templates, you may exclude any Personal Templates usage by clicking the box to exclude "Personal Templates Usage."
- By default, we *exclude *Templates sent to colleagues (colleague emails refer to emails sent to people with the same domain as you) from the data, however, if you'd like to include those numbers, select the check box to include "Colleague Emails."
