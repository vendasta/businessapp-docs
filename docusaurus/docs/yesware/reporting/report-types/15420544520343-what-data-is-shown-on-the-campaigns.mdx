# What Data is Shown on the Campaigns Dashboard?

The Campaigns Dashboard provides a quick overview of the usage and performance of personal and team Campaigns. It allows all team members to view the Campaigns performance of all members of their Teams from the last 12 months.
For each Campaign, it shows a summary of the touches with the number of recipients currently in progress for each touch, the total number of in-progress recipients, the number of recipients on the Campaign who received at least one email touch or a phone call, the percentage of those recipients who opened at least one tracked email, the percentage of those recipients that clicked at least one tracked link (if the campaign contained tracked links), and the percentage that receive a connection, as well as the total meetings booked through Meeting Scheduler across all the users of the campaign.
Use the "Search" function to find a Campaign by name or recipients on any Campaign by name or email.
The report includes when the data was last refreshed, as well as the following metrics:
**Campaign Details: **The name of the Campaign, the user who owned it, and the team(s) shared with (if any).
**Recipients/Touch: **A visual summary of the Campaign touches with the number of recipients currently in progress for each touch.
**In Progress**: Total number of in-progress recipients for this Campaign.
**Total Recipients:** Total recipients in progress (on the Campaign) during the last 12 months who received at least one email touch or a phone call.
**Open Percentage**: Of all the recipients added to a Campaign who received at least one email touch, the fraction of recipients who opened an email touch at least one time.
**Click Percentage**: Of all the recipients added to a Campaign who received at least one email touch, the fraction of recipients who clicked an email touch at least one time where the "Track Links &amp; Template Attachments" box was checked off.
**Connect Percentage:** Of all the recipients added to a Campaign who received at least one email touch or a phone call, the fraction of recipients that replied at least once, were marked as "Connected" for a phone call task, or booked a meeting through Meeting Scheduler. Please note that the reply can be to a different message (all inbound emails and replies in threads outside of the Campaign are considered if the recipient hasnâ€™t been added to another Campaign).
**Meetings Booked**: Total number of recipients (on the Campaign) who booked meetings through [Meeting Scheduler](https://app.yesware.com/meeting_scheduler).
