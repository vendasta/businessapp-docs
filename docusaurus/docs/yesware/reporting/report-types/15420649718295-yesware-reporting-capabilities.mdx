# Yesware Reporting Capabilities

Understanding what’s effective isn’t always easy. Closed deals and tangible results are good for measuring success, but they don’t answer the question of how you got there. Having clear insight into the sales process as well as individual and team performance speeds up and fine-tunes your selling. That’s why we’ve built a suite of reports to give our users the insight you need to thrive.
My Dashboard
The [My Dashboard](/docs/reporting/report-types/what-is-my-dashboard-in-reporting) view in Yesware's reporting shows a snapshot of your personal activity and it highlights insights regarding your recipients, as well as content performance for the last 7 days. The dashboard will provide a centralized place to quickly view key data &amp; answer questions to improve sales performance.
Email Activity Report
With the [Email Activity Report](https://support.yesware.com/hc/en-us/articles/15420538159127-What-Data-is-Shown-on-the-Email-Activity-Reports-), we put the data in your hands to help you make real connections even faster. The activity report provides an overview of how you’ve been using Yesware to communicate with your prospects. All team members are able to view team performance stats to learn from one another and improve together. Not only does it give team leaders an easy-to-read view of team tracking performance, but it also allows all team members to view the email activity (including Sends, Open %, and Reply %) of the other members of their team(s). This information can be [easily sorted](/docs/reporting/report-types/how-do-i-filter-in-the-email) and [reporting periods can be specified](/docs/reporting/report-types/how-can-i-filter-by-date-range) to provide critical, granular insights.
Templates Report by User
Sales is a team sport, and where one salesperson succeeds - everyone succeeds. That's why we think you’ll love this Report. The [Templates Report by User](/docs/reporting/report-types/what-data-is-shown-on-the-templates) provides a quick overview of the usage and performance of personal and team Templates. The report breaks down Template usage by individual user, so sales leaders can guide their team strategy and individual team members can see how their colleagues work - and how their own performance stacks up.
Templates Report by Template
The [Templates Report by Template](/docs/reporting/report-types/what-data-is-shown-on-the-templates) provides a quick overview of the usage and performance of specific, individual personal and team Templates. The report breaks down Template usage by each Template, so sales leaders can determine which Templates are performing well and which could use a little work, and individual team members can see which Templates their colleagues are using successfully and follow suit.
Campaigns by User Report
The [Campaigns by User Report](/docs/reporting/report-types/what-data-is-shown-on-the-campaigns) provides a quick overview of the usage and performance of personal and team Campaigns. It allows all team members to view the Campaigns performance of all members of their Teams for 13 months. It shows the number of recipients who have gone through a Campaign who received at least one email touch or a phone call, the percentage of those tracked emails that are opened, the percentage of those that have a link or Template attachment that has been clicked, and the percentage that receive a connection. You can drill down into each team member to access detailed Campaign analysis for that User.
Campaigns by Campaign Report
The [Campaigns by Campaign Report](/docs/reporting/report-types/what-data-is-shown-on-the-campaigns) provides a quick overview of the usage and performance of personal and team Campaigns. It allows all team members to view the Campaigns performance of all members of their Teams for 13 months. For each Campaign, it shows the number of recipients who have gone through a Campaign who received at least one email touch or a phone call, the percentage of those tracked emails that are opened, the percentage of those that have a link that has been clicked, and the percentage that receive a connection. You can drill down into each campaign to access a detailed analysis of each campaign touch.
Recipient Engagement Report
The [Recipient Engagement Report](/docs/reporting/report-types/what-data-is-shown-on-the-recipient) outlines how engaged each of your recipients has been with your emails to help you determine where to spend your valuable time. This report summarizes for each recipient how much they have interacted with the content you are sending to them. You no longer have to rely on individual email tracking to try and build the bigger picture for each individual recipient. 
Link Click Engagement Report
The [Link Click Engagement](/docs/reporting/report-types/what-data-is-shown-on-the-link) report shows you how your recipients are engaging with the hyperlinks you're sending in your emails, displaying all the tracked links that at least one recipient clicked in a selected period.
Personal Tracking Report 
The [Tracking Report](https://app.yesware.com/reports/tracking) details your outbound prospecting performance in an easy-to-read graph with details including emails sent, emails tracked, and open / reply statistics. The personal version of the tracking report allows you to filter, sort, and search your full email tracking history while also giving you a quick view of your past 30 days. Using the filtering, you can see a full history of your communications with specific prospects as well as their history of how they interact with your messages. By clicking on the subject line of the message, you can find a more detailed report, including the location and IP address associated with the event.
Campaigns Dashboard
Users on the Premium and Enterprise plans have access to our Campaigns Dashboard, which is also where you create your Campaigns. In the Campaigns dashboard, you can easily find the Open, Click, and Connect rates and Meetings Booked for the last 12 months for each Campaign at the overall Campaign level for your own Campaigns.  By clicking on each Campaign, you can see these stats for the individual touches that make up the entire Campaign. The data updates every hour.
Salesforce Reporting &amp; Dashboards 
Users on our Enterprise plan have access to our full integration with Salesforce. We’ll automatically capture all of your Yesware activity, associate it with the correct Contact or Lead, and store that information in your Salesforce account.
Since we standardize the way that we log our data, it becomes quick and easy to use the [Salesforce reporting tools](/docs/salesforce-integration/getting-started/measure-your-team-s-yesware-effectiveness-with) to see exactly how each individual prospect has progressed over time from initial contact to closed deal using Yesware data. We package a few sample reports, but there are no limitations to what you can use this data to discover.
