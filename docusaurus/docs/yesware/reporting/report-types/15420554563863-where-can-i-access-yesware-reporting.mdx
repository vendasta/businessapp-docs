# Where Can I Access Yesware Reporting?

There are a number of ways you can access Yesware's Reporting. For both **Gmail and O365** users, you can go directly to our [app site](https://app.yesware.com/reports/activity/#/activity) and navigate to the "Reports" section of the left-hand margin.
### Gmail
For **Gmail** users, reporting can be found right within your inbox. Simply select the "My Reports" button at the top of Gmail.
**Gmail** users can also access reporting by clicking on the Yesware drop down menu at the top left of Gmail and selecting the "My Reports" option.
### Outlook
If you are using **O365**, you can click the "Open Reporting" button in your Outlook Ribbon in the inbox.
**O365** users can also access reporting by clicking on the "Menu" button of the Yesware Sidebar and selecting "View Reports."
