# What Data is Shown on the Campaigns Report by Campaign?

The [Campaigns by Campaign Report](https://app.yesware.com/reports/by_campaign/#/campaigns/by_campaign) provides a quick overview of the usage and performance of personal and team Campaigns. It allows all team members to view the Campaigns performance of all members of their Teams for 13 months. You can also click on a campaign to get a more detailed analysis of the campaign's touch performance.
For each Campaign, it shows the number of recipients who have gone through a Campaign who received at least one email touch or a phone call, the percentage of those tracked emails that are opened, the percentage of those that have a link that has been clicked, and the percentage that receive a connection, as well as the total meetings booked through Meeting Scheduler across all the users of the campaign. This report is designed to help you understand Campaign activity and outcomes to improve how you and your team use Campaigns for prospecting and follow-up, by comparing what’s working or not working.
Use the "Search" function to find a Campaign, all the campaigns owned by a specific teammate, or all the Campaigns shared with a specific team, and use the date filter to see a specific time frame. This information can be easily sorted for more deliberate searching to compare successful Campaigns engagement across an entire team. 
The report includes when the data was last refreshed, as well as the following metrics:
**Campaign: **The name of the Campaign, the user who owned it, and the team(s) shared with (if any)
**Total Recipients:**  Total recipients in progress (on the Campaign) during the reporting period who received at least one email touch or a phone call.
**Open Percentage**: Of all the recipients added to a Campaign who received at least one email touch or a phone call, the fraction of recipients who opened an email touch at least one time.
**Click Percentage**: Of all the recipients added to a Campaign who received at least one email touch or a phone call, the fraction of recipients who clicked an email touch at least one time where the "Track Links &amp; Template Attachments" box was checked off.
**Connected Percentage:** Of all the recipients added to a Campaign who received at least one email touch or a phone call, the fraction of recipients that replied at least once, were marked as "Connected" for a phone call task, or booked a meeting through Meeting Scheduler.  Please note that the reply can be to a different message (all inbound emails and replies in threads outside of the Campaign are considered if the recipient hasn’t been added to another Campaign).
**Meetings Booked**: Total meetings booked through [Meeting Scheduler ](https://app.yesware.com/meeting_scheduler)across all the users' Campaigns - note this is only the first meeting booked per recipient in the Campaign.
**You can drill down into each campaign to access a detailed analysis for each campaign touch by clicking on the campaign row.**
