# What Data Is Shown on the Link Click Engagement Report?

The [Link Click Engagement](https://app.yesware.com/reports/link_click/#/link_click) report shows you how your recipients are engaging with the hyperlinks you're sending in your emails. It will display the total number of clicks that a given link has received within your selected time period. You'll also see the total number of tracked emails that contain the link, assuming it was clicked within the selected period. Please note, emails sent that have *not* had any engagement within the selected period are omitted from this tally.  
Filter and sort by time period, link, number of emails, and number of total link clicks. You can also click on "View Recipients" in the right-hand column to see who has clicked on the given link and how many times they clicked on it. 
Click "Download Report" to export to CSV the data contained in the table. Feel free to customize the data to your needs before downloading to ensure you're only exporting the information you want.
