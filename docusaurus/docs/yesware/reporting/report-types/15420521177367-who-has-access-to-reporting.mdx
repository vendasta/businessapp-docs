# Who has access to reporting?

All Premium and Enterprise users can view reporting for all the members of the teams that they belong to and their own personal reporting. Having clear insight into the sales process as well as individual and team performance speeds up and fine-tunes your selling. Reports are particularly valuable for:  
**Team Leaders,** who need an easy-to-read summary of their team’s performance
**Team Members,** who want to see how they’re performing relative to their peers and learn from their colleagues
Pro users will only see their own personal reports.
If you have any questions or concerns regarding the visibility of reports, please reach out to our Customer Support team by using the ["Submit a Request" form](https://support.yesware.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).
