# Create And Save Email Templates That Live In Your Outlook Inbox

Templates are at the core of Yesware—they let you create personal, customized messages for every stage of your process. At their most basic, Templates are messages that you’ve saved to your Yesware account that you can use for future emails. They allow you to send rich, complete emails in a fraction of the time it would take to draft that message each time you needed it. On the Premium and Enterprise editions of Yesware, Templates can be shared across entire teams. We’ve also built [reporting](what-data-is-shown-on-the-templates.mdx) around Templates, helping you see which are your most effective.

### How to Create a Template
In the Outlook ribbon, click "Open Templates." This will bring you to the Templates section of the [Yesware App](https://app.yesware.com/account).  Click " New Template" in the upper right and then type out the message exactly how you’d want it to save as a Template. From there, update the template name, subject, and style options. Once you are all set, click "Save Template" and your Template will be available for use.
No matter how great your Template copy is, you’ll always want to gear it so that it’s unique to each one of your recipients. You might want to add in their name, a note about what you most recently spoke about, or set any numbers and figures to be specific to your recipient. When drafting your Templates, put anything that should be fine-tuned before sending your email into [merge fields](https://support.yesware.com/hc/en-us/articles/15420615050775-How-do-I-use-Placeholders-Merge-Fields-in-Templates-) and Yesware will make it easy to update.
At the bottom of the Templates editor, click "Insert Merge Field," and we'll help you to create placeholders to insert personalized text when you are using the Template.
We offer two different types of placeholders (three, if you're on our Enterprise plan,) Text Fields and Dropdown Fields, that can be used in Templates. The Text Field acts as a blank, free-form text entry field. The Dropdown Field acts as a pick-list and when using the Template, you will be able to choose from any of the options that you defined when creating the template.
- Text Field - In the Template editor, select "Text Field” in the Insert Merge Field menu. Name the text field and click “OK.” If you use multiple Text Fields in a single Template and name them the same thing (for instance, two text fields both called “Name,”) filling in one of those Text Fields will fill in both.
- Dropdown Field - In the Template editor, select the "Dropdown Field” button. Name the dropdown field and create up to 5 options to select from.
If you are on [our Enterprise plan](http://www.yesware.com/plans-and-pricing), you can use dynamic fields to [pull in information](https://support.yesware.com/hc/en-us/articles/15420552270103-What-Salesforce-information-populates-dynamic-Templates-) from the recipient's record in Salesforce. When entering a new Template in the Outlook compose window, we will look at the first recipient in the "To" field. If a matching contact or lead is found, we will [populate the dynamic fields](https://support.yesware.com/hc/en-us/articles/15420528206487-How-do-dynamic-templates-work-with-Salesforce-) in your Template with information from any matching Salesforce fields such as their name, company details, job title, etc.
When you add hyperlinks to your Templates, they will automatically be set up as tracked links so that you're able to get a sense of who is engaging with your content. This helps you to prioritize and plan your follow-ups with ease.
### How to Use a Template
To use a Template, enter your recipient's email info into the "To" field of the compose window. Then, click "Add Template." Find the Template you'd like to use. From there, you can either click on the Template itself to fill in the merge fields or click "Insert." "Insert" will insert the Template as is, complete with the merge field formulas. You'll only want to use "Insert" if you have a Template that doesn't have merge fields that need filling in. By clicking on the Template you want to use, you can then fill in your text fields and choose an option from the dropdown list you've created.
### Team Template Sharing
Yesware helps teams streamline their email communications with Team Template Sharing.
Our Premium and Enterprise plans include a centralized Team Template library where you can collaborate and share the most effective Templates with your team. To move your personal Templates to the team categories, select the Template you'd like to move, click "More" in the bottom right corner, and then select "Move." Choose then where you want to move that Template.
Alternatively, you can head to your Yesware account to Manage Templates.
### Gain Insight with Template Reporting
The more insight you have into your emails, the easier it is to improve them to see better results.
We built Template Reporting to help you understand 1) how you’re using Templates and 2) how your recipients are interacting with them.
You can access reporting by clicking on the [Reports](https://app.yesware.com/reports/activity/#/activity) section of Yesware. From here, you can take a look at your Template Activity.
Reporting can help you identify which messaging works with recipients so that you can send smarter emails.
