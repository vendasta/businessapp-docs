# What data is shown in the Templates Report CSV?

Yesware offers the ability to download Template activity for up to 365 days. The Templates report shows you the Template performance of all members of you and your team(s). It shows the number of unique Templates sent, the number of tracked emails sent with at least one Template inserted, the percentage of those tracked emails that are opened and the percentage that receive a reply.
The CSV report will show the data range, including when the data was last refreshed, as well as the following metrics:
**Templates used -** The number of unique Templates inserted into emails that were sent with tracking.
**Number of Emails Tracked with a template -** The total number of tracked emails sent that included at least one Template.
**Open Percentage Rate -** Of all tracked emails that included at least one Template, the percent of messages that received at least one open.
