# What Data is Shown on the Templates Report by User?

The [Templates Report by User](https://app.yesware.com/reports/templates/#/templates/by_user) provides a quick overview of the usage and performance for personal and team Templates. It allows all team members to view the Template performance of all members of their Teams. It shows the number of unique Templates sent, the number of tracked emails sent with at least one Template inserted, the percentage of those tracked emails that are opened and the percentage that receive a reply. This information can be [easily sorted](/docs/reporting/report-types/how-do-i-filter-in-the-email) and [reporting periods can be specified](/docs/reporting/report-types/how-can-i-filter-by-date-range) for more deliberate searching.
The report includes when the data was last refreshed, as well as the following metrics:
**Templates used -** The number of unique Templates inserted into emails that were sent with tracking.
**Number of Emails Tracked with a template -** The total number of tracked emails sent that included at least one Template.
**Open Percentage Rate -** Of all tracked emails that included at least one Template, the percent of messages that received at least one open.
**Reply Percentage Rate -** Of all tracked emails that included at least one Template, the percent of messages that received at least one reply.
