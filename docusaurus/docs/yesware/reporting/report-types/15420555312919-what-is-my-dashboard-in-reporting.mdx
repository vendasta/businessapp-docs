# What is "My Dashboard" in Reporting?

The "[My Dashboard](https://app.yesware.com/reports/dashboard/#/dashboard)" view in Yesware's reporting shows a snapshot of your personal activity and it highlights insights regarding your recipients, as well as content performance for the last 7 days.  
The dashboard will provide a centralized place to quickly view key data &amp; answer questions to improve sales performance, such as:
- "What was my email activity the last 7 days?"
- "How is my overall Templates performance? Is it improving?"
- "How many recipients are actually engaging with my emails?"
- "Are recipients interested in the content I'm sending to them?"
- "Who has engaged the most?"
- "What content is generating the most interest?"
### **What does the report include?**
**Emails Tracked:** Total tracked emails sent in the last 7 days. **Templates Reply Rate:** Percent of tracked Templates that have received a reply in the last 7 days. **Recipients on Engaged Emails:** Total unique number of recipients in all the engaged emails in the last 7 days.**Total Link Clicks:** Total number of clicks in the last 7 days. **What Recipients Are Engaging?:** This card shows the name of the person who performed the below actions the most in the last 7 days.
