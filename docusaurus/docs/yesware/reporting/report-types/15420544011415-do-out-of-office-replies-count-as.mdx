# Do Out of Office Replies Count as a "Reply" in the Email and Template Activity Reports?

**No.** If we detect an Out of Office auto-reply message when emailing a recipient, we will not count that as a reply in the [Email](https://app.yesware.com/reports/activity/#/activity) and [Template](https://app.yesware.com/reports/templates/#/templates/by_user) Activity reports.
