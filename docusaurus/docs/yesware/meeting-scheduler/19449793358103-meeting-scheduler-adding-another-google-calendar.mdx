# Meeting Scheduler: Adding Another Google Calendar

Your Google Calendar automatically syncs to the email address that you sign up for with Yesware, however, you can add another Google Calendar email address to your scheduler.
From your Google calendar click on the Gear icon &gt; Click on subscribe to a new calendar &gt; Add your email to the 'add a new calendar' bar &gt; a pop up will say you don't have access to the calendar, click request access (see screenshots).
At this point, your other email address will receive an email asking for your permission, click on the 'accept request' at the bottom of the email and you should be all set. Go to the meeting scheduler page (https://app.yesware.com/meeting_scheduler) and click to edit a 'meeting type' and select the calendar you want.
