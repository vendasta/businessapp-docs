# How to Use Zoom Details in Meeting Scheduler

Yesware’s **Zoom integration** allows users on **Premium and Enterprise plans** to automatically insert Zoom meeting details when someone books a time using **Meeting Scheduler**.
This integration works for both **Meeting Types** and **Custom Availability** links, and is supported for users on **free or paid Zoom plans**.
### How to Connect Your Zoom Account
Go to your **Meeting Scheduler Settings**.
Click **Edit Details** on your **My Calendar Link**.
In the **Web Conferencing** section:
**Gmail users**: Click **“Connect Zoom Account.”**
**Outlook users**: Click **“Link Account”** under the Zoom option.
A popup will appear that says: *“Connecting your Zoom account. This window will automatically close when the connection is successful.”*
**
If you experience issues, refer to [Zoom’s documentation](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/sections/200704559-Installation) for installation help.
### Inserting Zoom into Meeting Types
To add Zoom details to a **Meeting Type**:
Open an existing Meeting Type or create a new one.
In the **Meeting Location** section:
**Gmail**: Click the **Insert Zoom** button.
**Outlook**: Click **Virtual Meeting**, then select **Zoom**.
A Zoom link will be auto-generated when the meeting is booked.
### Inserting Zoom into Custom Availability Links
When creating a **Custom Availability** link:
In the **Location** section:
Click the **Zoom** button (appears for both Gmail and Outlook users).
The Zoom meeting link will be automatically added when the recipient books time.
### What the Recipient Sees
Once a booking is confirmed, your **Zoom meeting details** will be included in the calendar invite sent to the attendee.
### Important Notes
**Personal Meeting ID (PMI)**: If your Zoom settings are configured to use your PMI, Yesware will respect that.
If PMI is not set, Yesware will generate a **unique Zoom ID** for each meeting (recommended for security).
**Password-protected meetings** are only supported if the Zoom **account administrator** has enabled password protection at the org level.
You **cannot manage Zoom settings** (like passwords or PMI preferences) within Yesware or on a per-meeting basis.
