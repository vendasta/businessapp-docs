# How is Meeting Priority Decided in Round Robin Scheduling?

We will ensure that all available times with at least one person available for the meeting are displayed to the recipient. In case multiple people are available at the selected time, we will book with the person who has had the least recently booked meeting in that round-robin. This guarantees that the customer has access to all available times.
Additionally, any additional colleagues added under ***Colleague Calendars and Availability*** will be included in the invitation without scanning their calendars for availability. They will simply be added to the invitation.
***Breathing Room, Working Hours, and Last Minute Meeting Protection* **will be applied for each user in the Round Robin to maintain efficiency and avoid scheduling conflicts.
