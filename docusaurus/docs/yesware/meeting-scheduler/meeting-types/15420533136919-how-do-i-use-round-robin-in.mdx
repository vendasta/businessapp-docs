# How Do I Use Round Robin In Meeting Scheduler?

### What is Yesware’s Round Robin for Meeting Scheduler?
Round Robin allows Yesware Team Leaders to create a Team Meeting Type that will rotate through available team members. This will create a link that a customer can click into, book a time that works and from there, we’ll assign the meeting to a member of the team that is available.
### Which Plan Is Round Robin Available On? 
Round Robin is available on our Enterprise Plan for both Gmail &amp; O365. 
### How do I use Round Robin in Meeting Scheduler?
If you have a Team Meeting Type that you’d like to include up to 15 team members on, you can use our Round Robin feature in Meeting Scheduler. Round Robin will allow you to add up to 15 team members to a rotation. Meeting links with Round Robin turned on will show all available times with 1 teammate available, allowing the recipient to book a time that works for them and will then route to an available team member. 
To turn on Round Robin, you’ll want to go into a Team Meeting Type or create a new Team Meeting Type. From there, you can take the steps below: 
- Toggle Round Robin Meeting ON 
- Select up to 15 teammates that you’d like to be a part of the Round Robin 
- Select Done
- Fill out the following fields: 
- Meeting Type Name
- Meeting Duration
- Meeting Link Text to Display
- Direct URL to Meeting
### Updating the Round Robin List
If you’d like to make changes to the Round Robin, click Settings to update the ON/OFF toggle next to the team members. From here you can edit which team members are a part of the Round Robin. 
### Removing Team Members from Round Robin
If you remove a member from the Team within your [Teams](https://app.yesware.com/account/member_teams) page, we will remove them from the Round Robin. You can also toggle the member OFF via the Round Robin settings for that Meeting Type.
### Logic to Determine Who the Meeting Will Book With
We will display all times that have at least 1 person available for the meeting. If there are multiple people available at the time the recipient selects, we will book with the person that has the least recently booked meeting in that Round Robin. This ensures that your customers have the best experience and have the most availability to choose from.
### Adding Colleagues to the Invite
You can add additional colleagues under *Colleague Calendars and Availability *but we will not scan their calendars for availability. If you add a colleague, we will just add them to the invitation. 
### Breathing Room, Working Hours, Last Minute Meeting Protection
Breathing Room, Working Hours, and Last Minute Meeting Protection will be applied for each user in the Round Robin. 
### What access do I need to create a Team Round Robin Meeting Type?
Whoever hosts and creates the Round Robin Meeting Type will need read access to the calendars of the teammates in the rotation. As long as you can read their calendar and see busy/free times in Gcal, and are a team leader of the team in Yesware, you’ll have access to create a Round Robin Meeting Type.
