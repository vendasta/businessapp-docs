# Can I set up different 'working hours' for my meeting types?

While your meeting types follow the working hours set up in your 'Meeting Scheduler Settings' by default, you can edit them to follow their own independent working hours.
Scroll down and click on its ‘Working Hours’ tab &gt; check off the ‘Set Meeting Type Working Hours’ box. This will allow you to select the days of the week and hours that you want this meeting type to work off of. Make sure to hit the ‘Save Meeting Type’ button after making these changes.
