# How Do I Use Meeting Scheduler with Gmail?

First, make sure that you have set up your Meeting Scheduler links by following [these instructions](/docs/general/15420622169367-how-do-i-set-up-meeting-scheduler).
Once you've done that, you can start to use your Meeting Scheduler Links in a compose window, Template, Campaign, or your signature.  Please note, whenever your recipient clicks on your links to book a meeting with you, it will always reflect your current availability and will be shown in their time-zone.  
### To Use in a Compose Window
Select the calendar icon at the bottom of your compose window to open up the Meeting Scheduler Menu.  
Here, you should have your general availability meeting link (My Calendar Link) as well as any [Custom Meeting Types](/docs/general/how-do-i-create-a-custom-meeting) you have created.  Selecting the "My Calendar Link" will insert a link into your compose window with your general availability, showing all of the Custom Meeting Types you've added so the recipient can choose the one that best suits their needs. 
If you instead select a Custom Meeting Type, it will insert the default hyperlinked text you set up when you [created the Custom Meeting Type](/docs/general/how-do-i-create-a-custom-meeting).  The recipient will only be able to book that specific meeting type when you send that Custom Meeting Type link.
You also have the option to choose "Select Custom Availability."  This lets you create a scheduling link for the specific recipient you are currently emailing (meaning anyone in the "To" or "CC" fields) and choose specific times you want to offer that recipient for that specific meeting.  [Click here](https://support.yesware.com/hc/en-us/articles/115007917548-What-is-Yesware-s-Book-A-Time-feature-) to learn more about offering custom availability.  
### To Use in a Template
At the bottom of the compose area in a Template, select the "Insert Meeting Link" button.  You can then choose if you'd like to use you general calendar link or a Custom Meeting Type.
### To Use in a Campaign
At the bottom of the compose area in a Campaign, select the "Insert Meeting Link" button.  You can then choose if you'd like to use you general calendar link or a Custom Meeting Type.
### To Use in your Signature
Navigate to your [Meeting Scheduler Settings](https://app.yesware.com/account/meeting_scheduler).  Decide if you want to include your general calendar link, which offers all your Custom Meeting Types, or a specific custom meeting.  Presumably you'll want to include the general link within your signature, but that's up to you.  When you decide, copy the link. Then, paste it into your Signature.
