# How to Add a Personalized Meeting Title in Meeting Scheduler

### How to Add a Personalized Meeting Title in Meeting Scheduler
When a meeting is booked through meeting scheduler, the calendar title will be generated as its 'Meeting Type Name'. Using the 'Personalized Meeting Title' option allows users to include dynamic custom fields that will pull from the required field answers to create new title replacing 'Meeting Type Name' as the meeting title on calendar events.
### How to set up a Personalized Meeting Title
- Start by clicking '+ Add Personalized Meeting Title'. (NOTE: Make sure to still fill in the 'Meeting Type Name' in the  box above)
- Create your title using the 'INSERT CUSTOM' fields option to insert the dynamic fields of your choice: 'Name', 'Company meeting, 'Host Name', 'Host email', 'Meeting Type Name', 'Attendee email', 'Attendee Name', 'Attendee Company Name'. 
- The selected custom field(s) will appear as a required field for recipients during booking. Once submitted, the generated title will pull the information provided from the required fields replacing the "Meeting Type Name" as the meeting title on calendar events
As your customers &amp; prospects book meetings using that link, we will now add the personalized details to the title of the meeting on all calendars.
