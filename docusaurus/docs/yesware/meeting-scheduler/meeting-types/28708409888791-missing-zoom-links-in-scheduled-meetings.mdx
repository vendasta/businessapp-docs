# Missing Zoom Links in Scheduled Meetings

If your Zoom links are missing from Meeting Scheduler events, try re-establishing the connection by following these steps:
**1. Unlink Zoom from your calendar settings:**
Go to **My Calendar Link Settings**.
In the **Web Conferencing** section, select **Zoom**.
Click **Unlink Zoom Account**.
**2. Remove Zoom as the location for each meeting type:**
Navigate to each **Meeting Type Settings**.
Under **Meeting Location**, click **Remove** next to the auto-generated Zoom meeting.
*Note: Youâ€™ll need to do this for each meeting type individually.*
**3. Reconnect your Zoom account:**
Go back to **My Calendar Link Settings**.
Under **Web Conferencing**, select **Zoom** and follow the prompts to re-link your account and log in to Zoom.
**4. Re-select Zoom as the location for each meeting type:**
For each **Meeting Type**, go to **Meeting Location** and select **Zoom** from the dropdown.
*Again, this step must be repeated for each meeting type.*
**5. Test the connection:**
Book a test meeting using your scheduler link to confirm that Zoom links are now populating correctly.
**Note: **Some users may not see the option to "Unlink." In such cases, simply use the "Link" button instead.
