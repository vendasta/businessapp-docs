# What is Meeting Scheduler?

With Meeting Scheduler, you’ll never have to ask, “When are you free?” again. Meeting Scheduler lets you create a scheduling link you can send to your recipients, allowing them to book meetings directly on your calendar.
Use the Meeting Scheduler settings to block off the times you are unavailable and create meeting types that reflect the different meetings you routinely have – think Intro Calls (30 mins), Demos (60 mins), etc. You’ll be able to send specific meeting types to your invitees, making life that much easier.
The tool integrates seamlessly with your calendar so that your meeting link is always up to date, and invitees will see only available slots in your calendar – reflected in their own time zone – so they can quickly confirm a meeting time that works for them.
You can also create an individualized link to send times specifically chosen for a recipient for a customized meeting.
