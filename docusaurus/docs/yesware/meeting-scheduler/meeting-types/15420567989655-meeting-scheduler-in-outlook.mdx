# Meeting Scheduler in Outlook

With Meeting Scheduler, you’ll never have to ask, “When are you free?” again.  Meeting Scheduler lets you create a scheduling link you can send to your recipients, allowing them to book meetings directly on your calendar.

Use the [Meeting Scheduler settings](https://app.yesware.com/account/meeting_scheduler) to block off the times you are unavailable and create meeting types that reflect the different meetings you routinely have – think Intro Calls (30 mins), Demos (60 mins), etc. You’ll be able to send specific meeting types to your invitees, making life that much easier. It integrates seamlessly with your Google calendar so that your meeting link is always up to date, and invitees will see only available slots in your calendar – reflected in their own time zone – so they can quickly confirm a meeting time that works for them.
