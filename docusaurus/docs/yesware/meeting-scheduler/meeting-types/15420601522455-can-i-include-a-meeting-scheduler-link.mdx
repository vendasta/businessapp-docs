# Can I Include a Meeting Scheduler Link in my Outlook Campaign?

**Yes! You can.Â **
When using the [Meeting Scheduler](/docs/meeting-scheduler/meeting-types/meeting-scheduler-in-outlook) Link in a Campaign, follow these steps:
1. *****Accessing the Meeting Link Button*****: While composing your email touch in the Campaign, locate the "Meeting Link" button at the bottom of the compose area.
2. *****Choosing Meeting Type*****: Click on the "Meeting Link" button and select whether you want to use your general calendar link or a Custom Meeting Type.
3. *****Inserting the Meeting Link*****: Once you've made your selection, the meeting link will be automatically inserted into your Campaign Touch content.
4. *****Booking a Meeting*****: Recipients of your email touch can then click on the meeting link to book a meeting with you.
5. *****Removal from Campaign*****: After a recipient books a meeting, they will be automatically removed from the Campaign. This counts as a "connection" and follows the default setting to remove recipients after a connection is made.
