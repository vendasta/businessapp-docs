# Will Meeting Scheduler Allow People to Book Back-to-Back Meetings?

**No - Not if you don't want them to.** You can use the "Breathing Room" feature under "Advanced Settings" in your [Meeting Scheduler Settings](https://app.yesware.com/meeting_scheduler/meeting-type-settings/create). If you need time to prepare or follow up between meetings, you can use this setting to give yourself a breather. For example, if you choose a 15-minute Breathing Room time, weâ€™ll make sure that you always have 15 minutes before and after any meetings.
