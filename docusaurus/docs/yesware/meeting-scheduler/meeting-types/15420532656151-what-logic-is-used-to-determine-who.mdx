# What Logic Is Used To Determine Who Gets The Meeting When Using Round Robin?

We will display all times that have at least 1 person available for the meeting. If there are multiple people available at the time the recipient selects, we will book with the person who has the least recently booked meeting in that Round-Robin. This ensures the customer has access to all available times.
You can add additional colleagues under *Colleague Calendars and Availability *but we will not scan their calendars for availability. If you add a colleague, we will just add them to the invitation.Â 
Breathing Room, Working Hours, and Last Minute Meeting Protection will be applied for each user in the Round Robin.
