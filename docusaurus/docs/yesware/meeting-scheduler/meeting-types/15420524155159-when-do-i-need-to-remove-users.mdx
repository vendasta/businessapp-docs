# When Do I Need To Remove Users From Round Robin?

If you’d like to make changes to the Round Robin, click Settings to update the ON/OFF toggle next to the team members. From here you can edit which team members are a part of the Round Robin. 
If you remove a member from the Team within your [Teams](https://app.yesware.com/account/member_teams) page, we will remove them from the Round Robin.
