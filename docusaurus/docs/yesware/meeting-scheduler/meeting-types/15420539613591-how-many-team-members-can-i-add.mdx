# How Many Team Members Can I Add To Our Round Robin?

With Round Robin you can add up to 15 teammates to the rotation. Meeting links with Round Robin turned on will show all available times with 1 teammate available, allowing the recipient to book a time that works for them and will then route to an available team member.
If youâ€™d like to make changes to the Round Robin, click Settings to update the ON/OFF toggle next to the team members. From here you can edit which team members are a part of the Round Robin.
