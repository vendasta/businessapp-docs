# Opened by Google image proxy server IP address 66.249.82.0

The IP address 66.249.82.0 is a Google image proxy server.
Often what happens is when your recipient opens the email, the images we use to track your opens are marked by Google as being opened not from the recipient's own IP address, but by one of Google's image proxy servers.
Unfortunately, we do not have any way to avoid this because whether images are "opened" by the recipient's IP or Google's image proxy is entirely up to Google.
