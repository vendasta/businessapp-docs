# Email extensions that are not tracked by Yesware

**Tracking Limitations for Emails Sent to Military and Government Domains**
When sending emails to military (.mil) or government (.gov) domains, please note that these domains often use specialized security software that blocks tracking features. As a result, tracking events may not be registered for emails sent to these addresses.
If you need confirmation of receipt or engagement with these emails, consider following up directly, as we cannot guarantee tracking will function as expected with these domains.
