# Can Recipients Tell If Emails Are Tracked in Yesware?

**Short Answer:**No, recipients cannot tell when emails are tracked.
**Explanation:**Yesware uses an invisible tracking pixel to monitor email opens and engagement. Unlike traditional read receipts, this pixel is completely hidden, meaning your recipient won’t notice any difference in their email experience.
You’ll gain valuable insights without impacting how the email appears to the recipient.
