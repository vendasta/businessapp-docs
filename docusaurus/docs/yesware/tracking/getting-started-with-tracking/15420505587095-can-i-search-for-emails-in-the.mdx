# Can I search for emails in the Tracking Feed in Outlook?

**No - Yesware's Activity Feed does not currently provide a search option.**
If you are looking for activity associated with a specific email thread:
- Go to the email thread by using Outlook's search bar or look for it in your sent folder
- Click on the email
- In your Yesware Sidebar, select the "Message" tab of the Tracking Feed to view the tracking history
You can also search your [Tracking Report](https://app.yesware.com/reports/tracking).
