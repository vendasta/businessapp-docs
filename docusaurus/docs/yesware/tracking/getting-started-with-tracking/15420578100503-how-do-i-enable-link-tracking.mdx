# How do I enable link tracking?

Yesware's **Link Click Tracking** feature allows you to see when a recipient clicks a hyperlink in your email. Once enabled, your links will automatically be converted into tracked links, and you’ll receive click notifications.
You can verify that a link is tracked by hovering over it—if the destination includes `https://t.yesware.com/tl...`, it’s being tracked.
**Best Practice:**We recommend **naming your links** rather than leaving them as raw URLs (e.g., use “Yesware” instead of “www.yesware.com”). This reduces the likelihood of your message being flagged as spam.
### Gmail
To enable Link Click Tracking:
Click the **Yesware drop-down menu** in the top-left corner of Gmail.
Select **"Preferences."**
Navigate to the **"Tracking"** section.
Toggle on **"Track Links."**
Once enabled, any hyperlink you insert will automatically become trackable.
### Outlook
To insert a tracked link in Outlook:
In your **compose window**, open the **Yesware Sidebar** (click **"Open Sidebar"** in your ribbon).
Select the **"Insert Tracked Link"** tab.
Fill in the following:
**Text to Display** – The word or phrase to hyperlink.
**URL** – The destination link.
**Title** – Optional text shown when the recipient hovers over the link.
**Note:** Links added to **Templates** are automatically set up as tracked links.
