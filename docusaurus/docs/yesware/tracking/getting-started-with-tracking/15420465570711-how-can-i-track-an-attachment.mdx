# How can I track an Attachment?

Tracking an attachment with Yesware allows you to see **who views your file**, for **how long**, and whether they **forwarded it**. Attachments are inserted as stylized links, and view data appears in the **Yesware Activity Feed** and **Presentation Report**, providing insights such as total views, time spent, and viewer names (if requested).
You can choose to:
**Allow recipients to download** the file (you won’t have visibility if they share a downloaded copy).
**Request recipients enter their name** for more detailed analytics—if someone forwards your email, both viewers can be tracked (unless the second person skips entering a name).
You’ll be notified when someone views the attachment, and you can access a full Presentation Report with engagement stats.
### Gmail
To track an attachment in Gmail:
Click the **blue paperclip icon** at the bottom of your compose window. 
Select your file.
If it’s a **PDF or PowerPoint**, you’ll see two checkboxes:
**Allow recipient to download**
**Ask the recipient to enter a name**
Make your selections and click **"Continue."**
The attachment will be inserted as a stylized link in the email.
*Note: Word Docs, Excel Sheets, and MP4s will skip the checkboxes and be inserted immediately.*
After sending:
You’ll be notified of views via the **Yesware Activity Feed** at the top of Gmail.
You can view the **Presentation Report** from the same feed.
### Outlook
To track an attachment in Outlook:
Open the **Yesware Sidebar** in your compose window (pinning it is recommended).
Click the **"Insert Tracked Attachment"** tab.
Select your file.
Two checkboxes will appear:
**Allow file download**
**Ask recipient for name for more detailed analytics**
Make your selections and click **"Insert Attachment."**
The attachment will appear in your email as a stylized link.
After sending:
You’ll receive a notification in the **Yesware Activity Feed** within the Sidebar.
To access the **Presentation Report**:
Go to your **Sent folder** and open the email.
Click on the **"Message"** tab in the Tracking feed.
Click the linked **Presentation Report**.
