# What is a tracking event?

A tracking event is a notification that occurs when:
A tracked email is opened
A link in a tracked email is clicked
An attachment or presentation is viewed
All tracking events are logged chronologically in your **tracking feed** (also known as the **Activity feed** in Gmail).
Users on **Yesware Pro, Premium, and Enterprise plans** can view **unlimited tracking events**.
