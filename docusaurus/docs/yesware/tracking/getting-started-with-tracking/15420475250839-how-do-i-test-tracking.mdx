# How do I test tracking?

To test that Yesware's email tracking is working properly, we recommend sending an email to **test@yesware.com**. This test account will open your email automatically, and you should see a tracking event appear in your **Yesware activity feed** within a few seconds.
When sending the test:
**Gmail users**: Make sure the **"Track" checkbox** is checked at the bottom of the compose window.
**Outlook users**: Ensure the **Yesware Sidebar** is open, or use the **"Send with Yesware"** button if applicable.
### Why You Shouldn't Send a Test to Yourself
Yesware does not log opens from your own email address on your own network, to avoid false positives. Sending a tracked email to yourself will typically **not trigger a tracking event**.
If you still want to test tracking yourself:
Send the tracked email to a **secondary email address** you own.
Open that email on a **mobile device using cellular data**, not WiFi.This helps avoid being filtered out as a "self-open" based on IP/network detection.
