# What does Yesware tracking track in Gmail?

Yesware tracks who opened your email, when it was opened, what type of device they used to read it, and in some cases, where they opened it.
Yesware can also track links clicked in emails if you enable [link tracking,](/docs/tracking/getting-started-with-tracking/how-does-link-tracking-work) and we offer [attachment and presentation tracking](/docs/tracking/getting-started-with-tracking/gain-valuable-insight-with-attachment-tracking-in) as well.
