# How to Turn Off Tracking in Yesware

Yesware's email tracking can be controlled at both the individual message level and globally, depending on your email platform. Here's how to disable tracking when sending messages or after the fact.
### For Gmail
**Turn Off Tracking for a New Email**
Open a **new compose window**.
In the lower-left corner, next to the Yesware icon, **uncheck the “Track” checkbox** before sending the email. 
**Turn Off Tracking for a Sent Email**
Go to your **Activity Feed**.
Select the message you want to stop tracking.
Slide the **Tracking toggle** to the **left** to disable further tracking (opens, link clicks, presentation views, etc.).
Alternatively:
Open the message thread in Gmail.
Click the **Tracking icon** in the top-right of the thread.
Toggle tracking **OFF** for that message.
**Turn Off Tracking Globally**
Click the **Yesware dropdown** in the top-left of Gmail.
Go to **Preferences** &gt; **Tracking**.
Set **“Track Opens”** to **OFF**.
Click **“Save and Reload.”**
### For Outlook (O365)
**Turn Off Tracking for a New Email**
Open a **compose window**.
Open the **Yesware Sidebar** (pin it for easier access).
Toggle **“Track Email Opens”** to the **OFF** position.
**Note:** In Outlook, **you cannot turn off tracking for a message after it has already been sent**.
