# How does Yesware email tracking work?

Ever wish you could read your recipient’s mind? With Yesware’s email tracking, you can get pretty close.
Email tracking tells you:
When your messages are opened, clicked, and re-opened in real-time
On what device your message was opened
When your links are clicked
All of this helps you follow up **smarter**.
When you send an email with Yesware, an **invisible tracking pixel** is embedded at the end of your outgoing message. When your email is opened, the pixel loads and triggers a notification—without the recipient ever seeing it. Unlike read receipts, Yesware’s tracking pixel is completely discreet, so the recipient experiences your message as usual while you gain valuable insights.
