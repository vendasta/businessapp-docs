# Can I track emails by using the Outlook Send Button?

**Yes!** To send a tracked email, first, make sure that you’ve got your ***Ye****sware sidebar open*** by clicking the "Open Sidebar" button in your compose window. You will not be able to track emails if you do not have the sidebar open. The easiest way to remember to do this is to pin the sidebar so that it is always open - just select the pushpin icon in the upper right-hand corner of the Yesware sidebar. Now, hit the send button and watch your recipients engage.
**Please note: **You may be on a version of Outlook that instead requires you to use the "Send with Yesware" button in the upper right side of your compose window to track an email. 
You will have to use the "Send with Yesware" button to track your emails:
