# How Do I Turn Off Tracking Notifications? (Gmail)

If you would like to stop receiving notifications for emails sent to your colleagues (Colleague Events), please visit the Yesware Preferences menu.
- Click on the "Yesware" drop-down at the top left of Gmail
- Select "Preferences."
- Go to the "Tracking" section
- Toggle "Colleague Events" off
This will disable notifications when a colleague opens a tracked email.
