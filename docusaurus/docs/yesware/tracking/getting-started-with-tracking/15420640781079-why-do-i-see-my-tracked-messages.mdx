# Why do I see my tracked messages in my Drafts folder?

When you ***Send With Yesware***, we save a draft so that we can add a pixel to track opens. If you see a message in your Drafts folder, that means Send with Yesware is working!The messages should move from your Drafts folder to your sent folder once Outlook syncs, but the sync time can vary. This can take a minute or so. Don’t worry - this doesn’t mean that the email hasn’t sent!If you’d like to confirm that an email has been sent, check your **Sent folder** instead. If you would like to send the content in a Draft to a different recipient, you will need to copy and paste that content into a new Compose window.
Find the Send with Yesware button frustrating?
You might be eligible to use the regular Outlook Send button to send a tracked email, instead of the Send with Yesware button, and as a result, there will be no delays.  
You only have to use the Send with Yesware button to track your emails:
If you use Outlook’s Mac Desktop App
- On the Outlook Mac desktop app, you can use "Send with Yesware." If you do not want to use "Send with Yesware." instead please use [Direct Install.](/docs/general/track-sync-emails-without-the-send-with) Direct Install works the same way as the 'Add-In Store' version, except it will say 'DI Install' on the sidebar banner. This will allow you to use the standard send button to track. If you have trouble switching over please reach out to [support@yesware.com](mailto:support@yesware.com) for assistance.
If you are not yet on Outlook's Version 2008 (Build 13127.21064) or above
- Don’t want to wait? Ask your IT team to update your Outlook version, use Outlook Web Access, or reach out to [support@yesware.com](mailto:support@yesware.com) for assistance.
