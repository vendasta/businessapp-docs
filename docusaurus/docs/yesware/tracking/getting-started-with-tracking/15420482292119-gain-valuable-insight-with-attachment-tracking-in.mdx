# Gain Valuable Insight with Attachment Tracking in a Compose Window

Yesware’s **Attachment Tracking** feature provides deep insight into how recipients engage with your files—allowing you to track views, time spent per page, and even recipient identities if requested. Whether you’re sending from Gmail or Outlook, tracking attachments gives you data that can help you qualify leads and prioritize follow-ups.

### How to Insert a Tracked Attachment
**In Gmail**:Click the **blue paperclip icon** at the bottom of the Gmail compose window.
**In Outlook**:Open the Yesware Sidebar in the compose window and click the **“Insert Tracked Attachment”** tab.
Once you add a **PDF or PowerPoint (PPT)** file, you’ll be presented with two tracking options:
**Allow recipient to download**:Recipients can download and keep the file. If they forward the file after downloading, you will not receive tracking data for those secondary viewers.
**Ask recipient to enter a name**:Recipients will be prompted to enter their name to access the file. If the email is forwarded, each new viewer can enter their name, allowing you to see **who viewed the file and for how long**. (This step can be skipped by the recipient if they choose.)
These settings only appear for **PDFs and PPTs**. For Word Docs, Excel Sheets, or MP4s, the file is still trackable, but without enhanced analytics or prompts.
### What Happens After Sending
The attachment is inserted into your email as a **stylized link**. Once opened, Yesware begins tracking recipient activity.
In **Gmail**, you’ll receive notifications in the **Activity Feed** at the top of your inbox.
In **Outlook**, notifications appear in the **Tracking Feed** of the Yesware Inbox Sidebar.
Tracked attachments will appear with an icon in the feed to differentiate them from regular message opens.
### Accessing Presentation Reports
**Gmail**: Click the presentation name in the Activity Feed or access the report via the top-right corner of the original email.
**Outlook**: Click the **“View All Attachment Analytics”** button on the event in the Tracking Feed.

These reports provide a detailed breakdown of:
Number of views
Average time spent
Pages viewed and downloaded
Last viewed timestamp
Device and IP location
Viewer name (if collected)
Yesware also displays **per-recipient engagement**, helping you identify your most engaged contacts.
### Salesforce Integration
If you're on the **Enterprise plan with Salesforce sync enabled**, presentation views will automatically sync to Salesforce. This allows full visibility into content engagement directly from the Contact or Lead record.
