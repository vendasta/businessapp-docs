# Can I search for emails in the Activity Feed in Gmail?

No - Yesware's Activity Feed does not currently provide a search option.
If you are looking for activity associated with a specific email thread:
- Go to the email thread by using Gmail's search bar or look for it in your sent folder
- Open the email
- Select the "Tracking" eyeball icon button at the top of the email thread to view the tracking history
You can also search your [Tracking Report](https://app.yesware.com/reports/tracking).
