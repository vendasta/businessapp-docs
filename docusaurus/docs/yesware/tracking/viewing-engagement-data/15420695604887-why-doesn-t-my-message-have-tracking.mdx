# Why doesn't my message have tracking data?

If you're not seeing any tracking data associated with an email, there are several possible explanations. These apply to both Gmail and Outlook users, with some platform-specific variations.
### Common Reasons for Missing Tracking Data
1. **The message is inbound and hasn’t received a tracked reply**
Yesware only tracks activity for emails that **you’ve sent with tracking enabled**. If you open an inbound message and haven’t replied with tracking turned on, no data will be available.
2. **Tracking was not enabled on the sent email**
**Gmail**:You may have forgotten to check the **Track** checkbox at the bottom of the compose window, or tracking was disabled in your Preferences.
**Outlook**:You may not have had the **Yesware Sidebar open**, or tracking was turned off in your settings.
Also note:Tracking will not function if the message was sent in **plain-text mode**.
3. **The recipient has images disabled**
Yesware’s tracking is **image-based**. If the recipient’s email client blocks images by default:
Opens will **not be registered**
You may still see **link clicks**, **presentation views**, or **replies**, even if the open wasn't recorded
4. **The message hasn’t been opened yet**
If the recipient simply hasn’t opened your email yet, no tracking event will be generated.
5. **You sent the message to a colleague and Colleague Events are turned off**
By default, Yesware can exclude internal sends from your tracking data. You can toggle this setting in your Preferences.
6. **Your Yesware login expired (Gmail only)**
If you’re using Gmail and your Yesware session expired, the tracking pixel may not have been inserted. Try logging out and back in again.
### How to Make Sure Your Emails Are Tracked
**Gmail**
Confirm the **Track** checkbox is checked in the compose window.
Go to **Preferences** via the Yesware dropdown in Gmail, and toggle on **"Track Opens."**
Make sure **Conversation View** is turned **ON** in your Gmail settings to see thread-level tracking.
Ensure **plain-text mode is disabled**:In the compose window, click the three dots and uncheck **"Plain Text Mode."**
**Outlook**
Keep the **Yesware Sidebar open** when sending to ensure tracking is applied.
Verify that open and click tracking are enabled in your **Yesware Settings**.
