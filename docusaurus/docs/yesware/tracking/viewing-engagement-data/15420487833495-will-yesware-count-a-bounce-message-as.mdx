# Will Yesware count a bounce message as a reply?

If we detect a bounce message when emailing a recipient, we will not count that as a reply.
We will record that a bounce was received on the [Tracking Report ](https://app.yesware.com/reports/tracking)in your Yesware account. Just click on the subject line of the email message in the linked Tracking Report and you'll be brought to more detailed reporting.
If you are on the Enterprise plan with Salesforce Sync enabled, we will sync the bounce notice into Salesforce.
