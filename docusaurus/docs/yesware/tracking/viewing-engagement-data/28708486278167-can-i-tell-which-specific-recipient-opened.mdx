# Can I tell which specific recipient opened an email with multiple people CC’d?

When an email is sent to multiple recipients (including those CC’d), Yesware cannot identify exactly which person opened it. Instead, you'll see a general notification such as, “John Smith or 5 others opened.”
To accurately track who opens an email, we recommend sending it to one recipient at a time.
