# Campaign Template: Spacing Issue

Occasionally, you may notice unnecessary spacing within the email body of a template. This issue can arise for the following reasons:
Copying and pasting content from Microsoft Word or other documents. The most common cause of poor template formatting is creating templates by copying data from external sources like Word documents, websites, or old emails.
When you copy content from one source and paste it into your template, hidden formatting can be carried over unintentionally. While this formatting might not be visible in Gmail, it can appear in other email clients, causing strange or unexpected email layout issues.
To avoid this, we recommend pasting the content into a plain-text editor before adding it to your template. This helps remove any hidden formatting.
