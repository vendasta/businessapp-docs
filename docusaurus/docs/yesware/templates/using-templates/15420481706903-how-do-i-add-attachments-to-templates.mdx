# How do I add attachments to Templates?

### How do I add attachments to Templates in Gmail?
Template creation allows adding attachments and tracked presentations. Just select "Insert Attachment" from the bottom of the Templates editor and select the file of your choice.
PDF and PPT files will prompt a tracked presentations window where you'll be presented with two check boxes (please note, these prompts will *only *appear for PDFs and PowerPoints. This step will be skipped for Word Docs, Excel Sheets, or MP4s):
- Allow recipient to download: This means that the recipient can download the PDF or PPT and then it is theirs to keep and do with as they please. Keep in mind that if they download the attachment and then share their downloaded copy, you will have no insight into who else has seen the PDF or PPT.
- Ask the recipient to enter a name to access the presentation: If you ask a recipient to enter their name to access the PD or PPT, you will then be able to see the name of each individual who has accessed the attachment and for how long they have viewed it. For example, if you send the presentation to John Smith and he looks at it and then forwards your email to Jane Doe and she looks at it, your Presentation Report will show you that both John Smith and Jane Doe have viewed the attachment. They *can* choose to skip adding their name.
