# How do I move Templates between folders/categories?

### Moving Templates Between Folders/Categories
As a Yesware user, you can create, edit, and manage your personal Templates. If you are a Team Leader, you can create, edit, and manage Team Templates and folders.
To do so, select the "Templates" menu at the top of your inbox, find and click the Template you'd like to move, select the "More" button at the bottom of the window, and then choose "Move Template." Choose where you'd like the Template to now live by selecting the folder name in the dropdown menu that appears. Click "Move Template."  
**Please note:** To move Templates to a Team folder, you must be a Leader on that Team.  
Reordering Templates within a folder is accomplished by navigating to the folder and selecting the "Custom Sort" button in the upper left. This will let you drag and drop Templates to get your desired order. 
To move Templates **through the [Yesware App](http://app.yesware.com/)**, click on the Templates icon in the left-hand menu. You’ll see each of your template categories listed here. When you click on any of these, each template under that category will be displayed. To move an existing template, find it on your list, select the "More" button at the bottom of the window, and then choose "Move Template." Choose where you'd like the Template to now live by selecting the folder name in the dropdown menu that appears. Click "Move Template." Note: any changes made through the Yesware App will require that you refresh your email to see the updates in the extension.
