# How do I add and track links on templates?

When you add hyperlinks to your Templates, they are **automatically set up as tracked links**. This allows you to monitor engagement and prioritize your follow-ups more effectively.
### Add a tracked link
Click the **chain link icon** in the template editor.
Enter the **URL** of the website.
Click **OK**.
**Best Practice:**Use **descriptive hyperlinks** instead of raw URLs (e.g., use *Yesware* instead of *[www.yesware.com](http://www.yesware.com)*). This reduces the likelihood of your message being flagged as spam.
### Note
**All hyperlinks** in Templates are tracked by default.
To **disable link tracking**, go to your **Yesware Preferences** and toggle off link tracking for Templates.
