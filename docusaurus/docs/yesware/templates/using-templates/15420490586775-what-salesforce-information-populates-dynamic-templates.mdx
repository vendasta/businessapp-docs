# What Salesforce information populates dynamic Templates?

When creating a new Template in the Gmail or O365 compose window, Yesware will look at the **first recipient in the “To” field**. If a matching **Contact or Lead** is found in Salesforce, Yesware will automatically populate dynamic fields in your Template using information from that record.
### How to Insert Salesforce Fields into a Template
In the Templates editor, click the **"Insert Merge Field"** button at the bottom of the compose area.
Select **"Salesforce field."**
As you type in the name of the field, a list of matching Salesforce fields will appear.
**Note:** Salesforce field merging is available only on the **Enterprise plan**.
### Formatting Salesforce Merge Fields
Templates must use the standard merge field format `\{!...\}`. For example:
`\{!Contact.FirstName\}` – pulls from a matching **Contact**
`\{!Lead.FirstName\}` – pulls from a matching **Lead**
`\{!FirstName\}` – works for either Contact or Lead without specifying the object
You can use any valid Salesforce field from a Contact or Lead object, including:
Phone number
Company name
Account name
Website
And more...
The merge field must match the **Salesforce API field name**, not the label name.
### Pulling from Account Fields
To use fields from an **Account** object (e.g., the Account tied to a Contact), you must **prefix the field name with the object name**:
`\{!Account.Website\}`
Yesware does **not support Opportunity objects** for dynamic field population.
