# Can I Create Dynamic Fields In Templates?

Yes! Yesware Templates support three types of dynamic fields called **Merge Fields **to help you personalize messages at scale. These can be used in both **Gmail** and **Outlook** templates, and can also be inserted into **Campaigns**.Â 
### 1. Text Field
Text Fields act as blank, fillable fields that you can complete before sending an email.
**How to add a Text Field:**
In the Template editor, click **Insert Merge Field**, then select **Text Field**.
Give the field a name and click **OK**.
When using the Template, you'll be prompted to enter your desired text.
If you reuse the same field name (e.g., "Name") in multiple places within a Template, filling one will fill them all.
### 2. Dropdown Field
Dropdown Fields allow you to predefine options that can be selected when using the Template.
**How to add a Dropdown Field:**
In the Template editor, click **Insert Merge Field**, then select **Dropdown Field**.
Name the field and create up to **five options**.
When using the Template, you'll be prompted to choose one of the predefined values.
### 3. Salesforce Field (Enterprise only)
Salesforce Fields allow you to pull data directly from Salesforce records.
**How to add a Salesforce Field:**
In the Template editor, click **Insert Merge Field**, then choose **Salesforce Field**.
Start typing the name of the Salesforce field; matching options will appear.
Select a field and click **OK**.
Yesware will automatically check the **first recipient in the "To" field** of your email:
If a **matching Contact or Lead** is found in Salesforce, the fields will be populated with data from that record.
Note: Salesforce Fields are available only to users on the **Enterprise plan**.
### Using Merge Fields When Sending Emails
**In Gmail**: Open a compose window and click the **Templates** button at the bottom. Click **Fill In** to populate fields or use **Insert** if no merge fields need filling.
**In Outlook**: Open a compose window, click the **Add a Template** button in the ribbon, and select your Template. Make sure to click the Template itself (not Insert) first to fill in the merge fields before sending.
### Using Merge Fields in Campaigns
You can insert any Template with Merge Fields into a **Yesware Campaign**, allowing you to send **personalized emails to many recipients** using dynamic fields that match:
Columns in a CSV upload
Table data
Salesforce fields
This allows you to scale your outreach while maintaining a personal touch without rewriting your message for every recipient.
