# Can I add videos to a template?

**Q: Can I add a video to my Yesware template?**
**A:** Currently, we do not offer a way to add video directly to a template. If you would like to include a video in your templates and or campaigns, you can capture a screenshot of your desired video and add it to the template as an image. 
Once you have an image or screenshot saved to your computer, you can use the 'Insert/edit Image' button to insert the image. Then, simply highlight the image and click the 'Insert Link' button to hyperlink the image. This will serve as a workaround so you can send a video in your template!
