# How to Use Placeholders/Merge Fields in Templates

Yesware offers two types of merge fields, **Text Fields** and **Dropdown Fields, **that allow you to personalize Templates quickly and efficiently. Enterprise users can also leverage **Salesforce Fields** for deeper personalization.
These merge fields can be used in both Gmail and Outlook, with slight differences in how Templates are inserted during email composition.
### Merge Field Types (Shared Across Gmail &amp; Outlook)
**1. Text Field**
In the Template editor, click **"Merge Field"** and then select **"Text Field."**
Give the field a name and click **"OK."**
Text Fields serve as blank, freeform inputs you can populate later.
If you use the **same field name** (e.g., `"Name"`) multiple times in a Template, filling in one will populate **all instances**.
**2. Dropdown Field**
In the Template editor, click **"Merge Field"** and then select **"Dropdown Field."**
Name the field and create up to **five options**.
Dropdown Fields function as a **picklist** when you're composing or previewing the Template.
### Using Templates with Merge Fields
**For Gmail**
Open a **compose window**.
Click the **“Templates”** button at the bottom of the email draft.
Select the Template you want to use.
Click:
**“Fill In”** to populate your merge fields interactively.
**“Insert”** to drop the template as-is (use only if the Template doesn’t require field input).
**For Outlook**
Open a **compose window**.
Click the **“Add a Template”** button in the Outlook ribbon.
Find and select the desired Template.*(No separate "Fill In" option; fields are filled within the Template workflow itself.)*
### Merge Fields in Campaigns (Gmail &amp; Outlook)
You can insert Templates with Merge Fields into **Campaigns** to send personalized emails to hundreds of recipients—all while only composing a single email. Merge Fields ensure each message feels individually crafted.
