# How do I edit or delete existing Templates?

### Editing and Deleting Templates for Gmail and Outlook users
As a Yesware user, you can create, edit, and manage your personal Templates. If you are a Team Leader, you can create, edit, and manage Team Templates and folders.
In Gmail, select the "Templates" menu at the top of your inbox, find and click the Template you'd like to update, and then click the "Edit" button at the bottom of the window.  Make necessary changes and hit "Save Template."  To delete a no longer needed Template, click "More," and then "Delete Template."
Note: any changes made will require that you use the refresh button on the mini Templates modal in your compose window, if you want to use the edited Template right away.
