# Does Yesware integrate with Okta?

**Q: Does Yesware support and integration with Okta?**
**A:** Yesware does not provide an integration with Okta, but many Yesware customers use Okta (and other SSO systems) successfully. Yeswareâ€™s primary authentication method is via OAuth to either Google or Microsoft. Typically, once a user is authenticated with Okta, they will also be authenticated with Google or Microsoft, and will be able to log in to Yesware without issue, however, user provisioning/de-provisioning within Yesware will have to be done manually, as it is not integrated with Okta.
