## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I use Yesware with GoDaddy email addresses?

**No, Yesware only supports Gmail and Outlook at this time.**

While GoDaddy hosted emails can be used through Microsoft Exchange, the Yesware Outlook Add-in requires a direct, Microsoft O365-hosted email address.

### Can I use Yesware for more than one email address?

Yesware is licensed by email address and not by computer or download.

If you are using the same email addresses across different computers, you would need to download the application on that new PC or Mac computer [Here](http://www.yesware.com/install) and then authenticate using your inbox's log-in credentials.

If you are using different email addresses, **each will need their own license**. You can add additional licenses to an existing account [HERE](https://app.yesware.com/account/manage).

**Please Note:** Any newly added email addresses will need to have their own log-ins and passwords. Yesware does not work with Alias or 'Send As' addresses.

### Can I install Yesware on a shared Mailbox?

Yesware integrates with your email account using Single Sign-On (SSO), which ensures that the add-in works exclusively with the email address you used to sign up for the service.

If you use shared mailboxes, the Yesware add-in may not function as expected when composing or viewing emails. Specifically, the add-in is designed to work only with the primary email address and inbox associated with your Yesware account.

#### What This Means for Shared Mailbox Users
- Emails created or opened using a shared mailbox will not be compatible with the Yesware add-in.
- To use Yesware's features, ensure you are working from the primary email address linked to your Yesware account.

If you need further assistance or have questions about shared mailboxes and Yesware, please reach out to our support team.

### How do I re-install Yesware if I'm getting an add-in error in O365?

If you are receiving the 'Add-in Error' message, follow these steps to reinstall Yesware for Office 365:

**In your O365 Inbox:**
- Click 'Get Add-ins' > My add-ins > Yesware - click the 3 dots and select 'Remove'
- Close Outlook
- Re-open Outlook
- Click 'Get Add-ins' > search for Yesware and select 'Add'

Next, within Outlook, please go to "**File**" > "**Office Account**" and click on "**Office Updates**" and in the dropdown select "**Update Now**". Then close out of Outlook completely and open it back up.

Then, open the Yesware Sidebar again and see if you are still receiving the "**Add-In Error**" message.

Please make sure to also have the Yesware Sidebar pinned open, within the New/Compose email window.

*Please reach out to Yesware Support if this does not resolve the issue.*
