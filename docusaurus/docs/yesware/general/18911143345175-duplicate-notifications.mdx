# Duplicate notifications

If you are receiving duplicate notifications across different devices, it is likely because iPhones and Androids typically end up creating two notifications for an open event. When a mobile device opens the email, two data requests are made - one from the IP of the phone and one from the IP of a data center.
Since there are two unique requests with different IPs and "locations," we send you two notifications.
