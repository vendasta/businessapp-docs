# Can I set a reminder retroactively or on an incoming message in Gmail?

To set a Reminder retroactively (perhaps you forgot to set the Reminder when you sent the email) or to set a Reminder on an incoming email that you're not quite ready to respond to or deal with:
- Open the email (whether already sent or incoming, depending upon the circumstance)
- Click the "Remind" button at the top of the email thread
- Here, set your parameters for the Reminder
- Click "Confirm"
