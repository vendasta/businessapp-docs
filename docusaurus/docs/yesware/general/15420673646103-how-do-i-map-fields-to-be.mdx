# How do I map fields to be merged from my CSV into my emails?

If you're importing recipients to a Campaign via the **CSV method** (created in Excel or exported from Salesforce), your .CSV file will serve as the source of merged data. You’ll need to map the columns from your CSV to the merge fields in your email.
Here’s how to do it:
**Create your CSV file.**
Whatever you name the columns in your CSV will become your merge field names.
The **"Email"** column must be the **first column** in the file.
**Insert merge fields into your email.**
Use the format `\{!columnname\}` where `columnname` matches the header from your CSV. 
This is **case- and space-sensitive**.
If you're using an existing Template, make sure your CSV column headers exactly match the merge fields in the Template.
**Use the "Merge Field" button** at the bottom of the compose area to:
Insert merge fields with accurate formatting
Avoid manual errors
Quickly match fields to column headers
**Check the "Preview and Personalize" tab** to confirm that your fields are mapped correctly before sending your Campaign.
