# Using Send Later in Gmail

**Send Later** is a Yesware feature that allows you to schedule emails to be sent at a future date and time. It’s available on all **Pro, Premium, and Enterprise** plans using Yesware for Gmail.
### How to Use Send Later
Open a new **compose window** and draft your email as usual.
Click the blue **paper airplane "Later"** button at the bottom of the compose window.
Choose the **date and time** you want the email to be sent, then click **Confirm**.
The send button will now display as **“Send on \{selected date\}.”**
When you're ready, click the **Send on \{date\}** button.
Your email will disappear from the compose window but will not be lost. It’s stored in your **Drafts** folder until the scheduled date and time. Yesware will send it automatically—**no further action is required.**
### How to Edit or Cancel a Scheduled Email
You can edit or cancel a Send Later message at any time before it’s sent:
Go to your **Drafts** folder and open the scheduled message.
Click the **arrow** next to **“Send on \{date\}.”**
Choose a new date and time, or click **“Unschedule”** to cancel the scheduled send.
### Where to View Scheduled Emails
You can view all upcoming Send Later emails in your **Drafts folder**.
They also appear in the **“Scheduled” tab** of your **Yesware Activity Feed** in Gmail.
