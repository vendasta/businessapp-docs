# How do I take action on a Custom Task in Campaigns in Gmail?

One of the available [touch types](/docs/general/what-touches-can-i-add-to-a) in [Campaigns](https://support.yesware.com/hc/en-us/articles/15420669475351-Set-up-multi-channel-Campaigns-from-your-inbox) for Gmail is a Custom Task. A Custom Task allows you to write yourself a reminder to take any kind of action you'd like. When putting together your Campaign, write yourself a note on what action you want to take: do research, set up a google alert, social media outreach, send swag, etc.Â 
To take action on a Custom Task, you must go to the [Campaigns tab of the Yesware sidebar](/docs/campaigns/creating-campaigns/how-do-i-access-my-to-do). If you've just added Manual tasks, don't forget to refresh the sidebar. From there, select the to-do card for your Custom Task, take whatever action you've prescribed, and then click "Done" when complete.
