# Track & Sync Emails Without the Send With Yesware Button (Outlook)

You might be eligible to use the regular Outlook Send button to send a tracked and synced email, instead of the Send with Yesware button. 
You only have to use the Send with Yesware button to track and sync your emails:
If you use Outlook’s Mac Desktop App
- We will keep you posted on when you can switch to using the Outlook send button, but at this time, it is TBD.
Don’t want to wait? Use Outlook Web Access or reach out to [support@yesware.com](mailto:support@yesware.com) and ask for [Direct Install.](/docs/general/track-sync-emails-without-the-send-with)
If you are not yet on Outlook's Version 2008 (Build 13127.21064) or above
Don’t want to wait? Ask your IT team to update your Outlook version, use Outlook Web Access, or reach out to [support@yesware.com](mailto:support@yesware.com) and ask for [Direct Install.](/docs/general/track-sync-emails-without-the-send-with)
If you use Outlook Web Access or are a PC user on Outlook Version 2008 (Build 13127.21064) or above, first make sure that you’ve got your Yesware sidebar open by clicking the "Open Sidebar" button in your compose window. **You will not be able to track and sync emails if you do not have the sidebar open in your compose window**. The easiest way to remember to do this is to pin the sidebar so that it is always open - just select the pushpin icon in the upper right-hand corner of the Yesware sidebar.  Now, hit the send button and watch your recipient engage!
