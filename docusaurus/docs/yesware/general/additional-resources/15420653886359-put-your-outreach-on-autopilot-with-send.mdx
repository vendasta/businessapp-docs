# Put your outreach on autopilot with Send Later in Gmail

Send Later allows you to schedule emails to be sent at a later date and/or time and allows you to specify the recipient’s time zone. It's a great tool for drafting an email right after a meeting or introduction when discussions and details are fresh in your mind.
Here’s what happens, and why it's super helpful:
- Write emails when convenient for you; we’ll schedule to send at your desired time
- Connect with prospects when they’re most likely to engage
- Put your outreach on autopilot

### How Send Later Works
To set up an email to be sent later, open up a compose window and write your desired message as you normally would. Instead of sending, click the blue paper airplane "Later" button at the bottom of the compose window and select the date that you’d like for your message to be sent.  Click confirm.    
The send button will now change to say, "Send on \{selected date\}."  When you're ready, click that button.  The email will disappear, but it doesn't actually.  It now lives in your Drafts folder until the date and time you've scheduled it to be sent and we will send it out for you on the back end - no further action necessary. 
If you'd like to cancel or edit the scheduled email, locate the message in the your Drafts folder, open the email, click the arrow next to "Send on...", then select a new date, time, or "unschedule" to remove it entirely.
You can view any of your upcoming Send Laters under the "Scheduled" tab of your tracking Activity Feed.
