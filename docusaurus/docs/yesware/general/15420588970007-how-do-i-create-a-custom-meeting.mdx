# How Do I Create a Custom Meeting Type in Meeting Scheduler in Gmail?

To create a Custom Meeting Type in Meeting Scheduler, navigate to your [Meeting Scheduler settings](https://app.yesware.com/account/meeting_scheduler).
To get started, click "Create Meeting Type" about halfway down the page.
**Fill out the following Meeting Details:**
**Meeting Type Name:** Here, categorize what type of meeting this will be by giving it a clear, concise name like "Demo," "Discovery Call," "Quick Connect," or "Account Review."
**Meeting Duration:** When your recipient selects this meeting type, how long do you want it to last?  For example, you'd probably want to make "Quick Connect" a 15-minute-long meeting.
**Meeting Location:** Tell your recipients how to access the meeting. Enter your dial-in details, or click the "Insert Zoom" button if you've enabled the Zoom integration.
**Date Range:** Select whether recipients can see the option 'Indefinitely' through your calendar or set up a specific number of days of how far into the future they can see your availability.
**Meeting Description:** Let your recipients know what this meeting will be about, including any agenda items if you have them.
**Meeting Link Text to Display:** This lets you insert pre-hyperlinked text into your emails. Decide how you want to present this specific scheduling link to your prospects and customers by linking a phrase. You might consider something like, "Click here for a product demo" if you're creating a Demo Meeting Type.
**Direct URL to Meeting: **This lets you create a custom URL that will direct your recipients to book this specific meeting type.
**Under "Show Advanced Settings" you'll find the following:**
**Add Custom Questions:** You can request that your recipient provide additional information such as phone number or company name so that you can be fully prepared for the meeting. Add your own custom questions to get more info.
**Add to Calendar:** Choose from your owned calendars to decide on which calendar the meeting will book.
**Add Others to Meeting: ** Allows you to add Colleagues to your meeting so that they will be added to the meeting when it is booked, and their schedule will be considered when presenting scheduling options to the recipient.
**Reschedule Link Settings:** A reschedule link can be found on the invitation of meetings booked through a meeting type. (As a default, all meeting types have this option checked off. Make sure to uncheck this box, if you do not wish to have a rescheduling option for your meeting type.)
**Working Hours: ** Allows you to create custom working hours for the meeting type, independent of the 'Meeting Scheduler Settings.'
Finally, click "Save Meeting Type" at the bottom of the page.
