# Is there an easy way to add my Meeting Link to a Campaign?

### Adding a meeting link to a campaign (Gmail and Outlook users)
To use your [Meeting Scheduler Link](https://support.yesware.com/hc/en-us/articles/15420636876695-Eliminate-back-and-forth-emails-with-Meeting-Scheduler) in a Campaign, find the "Meeting Link" button at the bottom of the compose area for your email touch. You can then choose if you'd like to use your general calendar link or a Custom Meeting Type. Once you select which you'd like to insert, it will add the meeting link to your Campaign Touch content, streamlining meeting booking workflows.
Once a recipient books a meeting, they will be removed from the Campaign, as this counts as a "connection" (if you've kept the default setting to remove recipients after connection).
