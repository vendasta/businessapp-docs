# How to turn off GeoIP locations

GeoIP locations are collected by a third-party service that we utilize. However, we do not control whether users’ GeoIP locations are shared with others. Users can configure these settings through their **computer's privacy settings**, **network security**, or **email domain policies**.
### Steps to Control GeoIP Location Settings
**For Windows**:
- Go to **Start** &gt; **Settings** &gt; **Privacy** &gt; **Location**.
- To control the location for the entire device (if you’re an administrator), click **Change** and toggle the setting to **On** or **Off** under the "Location for this device" message.
**For Mac**:
- Go to the **Apple menu** &gt; **System Settings**.
- In the sidebar, select **Privacy &amp; Security** (you may need to scroll down).
- Click **Location Services** on the right, then turn off **Maps** or any other apps using location services.
- You can also choose to turn off **Location Services** for all apps.
By following these steps, users can control how their GeoIP location is shared and which applications can access this information.
