# Mute notifications on Yesware [Chrome]

While Yesware does not offer an option to mute notifications directly, you can turn them off. If you're using Google Chrome, there is a workaround:
- Open your Chrome extensions.
- Click the **three dots** next to **Yesware Sales Engagement**.
Select **Manage Extension.**
Click on **Site Settings.**
Navigate to **Sound** and hit** Mute.**
