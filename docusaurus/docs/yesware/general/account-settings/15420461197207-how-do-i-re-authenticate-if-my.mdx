# How do I re-authenticate if my Yesware login has expired in Gmail?

In order to use Yesware, you need to authenticate your email with Yesware. If your authentication expires, Campaigns, Send Later, Reminders, Salesforce Sync, and other Yesware features will not work properly until you sign back into Yesware.
These are potential reasons you might need to re-authenticate:
- You changed your password
- Your authorization token has expired
- You changed your email address
- Your email account is no longer active or valid
**To re-authenticate, simply sign-out of your Gmail inbox and sign back in. **
**Note:** If you’re not authenticated, you’ll still be able to send a tracked email, but you will not be able to see any engagement until you re-authenticate.
To re-authenticate, click on** Sign in to Yesware** in your Gmail.
You can also visit app.yesware.com and choose** Sign in with Google** to log in.
Please note that **any failed Campaigns, Send Later messages, and Reminders cannot be restarted**.
