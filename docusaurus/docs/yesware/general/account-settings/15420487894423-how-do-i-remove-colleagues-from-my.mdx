# How do I remove colleagues from my account?

To remove colleagues from your account, you must be a **Yesware admin/account manager**. To access the self service portal, select the Yesware drop down in Gmail and select **My Account &gt; Settings.** From there, navigate to the **Users** section of the left hand menu. Then select the user(s) you would like to remove and click the **Remove** button in the upper left corner of the modal.
