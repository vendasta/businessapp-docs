# Add and edit colleagues on my account

To add colleagues to your account, you must be a Yesware admin/account manager. To access the self-service portal, select the Yesware drop-down in Gmail and select, "My Account". From there, navigate to the "Users" section of the left-hand menu.Â  In the upper right, there is an "Add Users" button. This button will allow you to fill empty licenses and/or purchase new licenses.
Please note that Yesware's subscriptions are per email address. If you are adding a new email address to your account, you'll be charged for an additional license. We'll confirm any additional charges before adding the new license.
If you'd like to add someone to your account, they must be on a verified domain. By default, verified domains will be the same domains associated with the Account Managers on your account. If you'd like to add a new verified domain, please use the "Send us a request" option in the top right section of this page to contact Support.
### Editing colleagues
To change the name of a colleague, the user would need to be deleted, and re-added with the correct name. You can also reach out to [support@yesware.com](mailto:support@yesware) and our team can help you edit a user!
