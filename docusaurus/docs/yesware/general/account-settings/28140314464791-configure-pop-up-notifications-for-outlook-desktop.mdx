# Configure Pop-up Notifications for Outlook Desktop in Chrome

**Here's how to enable desktop notifications for Yesware tracking events:**
- From the Yesware sidebar, navigate to the **'Tracking'** tab.
- At the bottom of the sidebar, click **'Open All Events in a New Window'**.
- This will open the tracking events in a new tab in your default browser (which can be set to Chrome). Once the tab opens, Chrome will prompt you to **'Allow'** Yesware to send desktop notifications. Be sure to click **'Allow'**.
Keep the tab open to continue receiving desktop notifications.
