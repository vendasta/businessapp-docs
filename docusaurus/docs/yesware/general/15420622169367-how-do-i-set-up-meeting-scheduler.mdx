# How Do I Set Up Meeting Scheduler in Gmail?

Meeting Scheduler provides reps with a complete automated workflow for booking meetings with customers and prospects, eliminating the back and forth emails in booking a meeting by creating a scheduling link you can send to your recipients, which allows them to book meetings directly on your calendar.
To set up Meeting Scheduler, open a new email message and click on the calendar icon at the bottom of the compose window to launch the Meeting Scheduler menu. Next, click the gear icon to open up the [Meeting Scheduler settings](https://app.yesware.com/account/meeting_scheduler).
Here, you can set the stage for your meeting link, which you will send to prospects or customers to book a time on your calendar.
**Display Name:** Enter what name you want to appear when an individual goes to book a meeting with you.  It will say "Book a time with *Display Name*."
**Welcome Message:** In this area, you can type out a greeting or instructions to your recipients, leave the default "book a meeting with me!," or even leave blank, if you'd prefer.
**Meeting Link Text to Display:** This lets you insert pre-hyperlinked text into your emails. Decide how you want to present this specific scheduling link to your prospects and customers by linking a phrase. You might consider something like, "Click here to book a meeting with me."
**My Calendar Link URL:**  This lets you create a custom URL that will direct your recipients to a page to book a meeting with you.  
**Web Conferencing:** If you use Zoom, you can [enable our Zoom integration](/docs/meeting-scheduler/meeting-types/how-to-use-zoom-details-in-meeting) to automatically insert your Zoom link into booked meetings.
Under "Show Advanced Settings" you'll find the following:
**Prevent Last Minute Meetings:** Use this setting to prevent your recipients from booking meetings at the last minute.  You can configure a limit of minutes or hours based on your preference! For example, if it is 3:29 pm and you set your Last Minute Meeting Protection settings to one hour, your recipients would not be able to book a meeting with you until 4:30 pm. If you want a full day's notice before having a meeting booked on your calendar, enter 24 hours in this setting.
**Breathing Room:** Need time to prepare or follow up between meetings? Use this setting to give yourself a breather.  For example, if you choose a 15 minute Breathing Room time, we’ll make sure that you always have 15 minutes before and after any meetings.
**Working Hours:**  Block off the times you are unavailable so you have complete control over who books meetings with you and when.  Don't want to take meetings on Fridays?  Uncheck that box.
Don't forget to save by clicking "Save Details."
From here, you'll want to establish Meeting Types.  Create meeting types that reflect the different meetings you routinely have – think Intro Calls (30 mins), Demos (60 mins), etc. You’ll be able to send specific meeting types to your invitees or give them the option to choose from all of your meeting types.  You can create as many meeting types as you'd like, but try not to overwhelm with options.
To get started, click "Create Meeting Type." 
**Meeting Type Name:** Here, categorize what type of meeting this will be by giving it a clear, concise name like "Demo," "Discovery Call," "Quick Connect," or "Account Review".
**Meeting Duration:** When your recipient selects this meeting type, how long do you want it to last?  For example, you'd probably want to make "Quick Connect" for a 15-minute long meeting.
**Meeting Location:** Tell your recipients how to access the meeting. Enter your dial-in details, or click the "Insert Zoom" button if you've enabled the Zoom integration.
**Meeting Description:**  Let your recipients know what this meeting will be about, including any agenda items if you have them.
**Meeting Link Text to Display:** This lets you insert pre-hyperlinked text into your emails.  Decide how you want to present this specific scheduling link to your prospects and customers by linking a phrase.  You might consider something like, "Click here for a product demo" if you're creating a Demo Meeting Type.
**Direct URL to Meeting: ** This lets you create a custom URL that will direct your recipients to book this specific meeting type.
Under "Show Advanced Settings" you'll find the following:
**Add Custom Questions:**  You can request that your recipient provide additional information such as phone number or company name so that you can be fully prepared for the meeting.  Add your own custom questions to get more info.
**Add to Calendar:** Choose from your owned calendars to decide on which calendar the meeting will book.
**Add Others to Meeting: ** Allows you to add Colleagues to your meeting so that they will be added to the meeting when it is booked, and their schedule will be considered when presenting scheduling options to the recipient.
**Reschedule Link Settings: ** A reschedule link can be found on the invitation of meetings booked through a meeting type. (As a default, all meeting types have this option checked off. Make sure to uncheck this box, if you do not wish to have a rescheduling option for your meeting type.)
**Working Hours: ** Allows you to create a custom working hours for the meeting type, independent of the 'Meeting Scheduler Settings'. 
Finally, click "Save Meeting Type" at the bottom of the page.
