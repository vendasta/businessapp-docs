# Will adding DMARC, DKIM, and SPF for Yesware improve my deliverability?

No - Yesware does not modify the IP address when it sends emails. Instead, Yesware transmits the campaign emails to your email server for delivery. Due to this, we cannot improve email deliverability or prevent your emails from being identified as spam. If your IP address is flagged as a spam host, the issue must be resolved with your service provider.
