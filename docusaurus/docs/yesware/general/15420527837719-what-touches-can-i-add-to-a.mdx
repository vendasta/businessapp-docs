# What touches can I add to a Gmail Campaign?

There are four types of touches in Campaigns (Gmail only): Automated Email, Manual Email, Phone Call, Custom Task.
For those using the [LinkedIn Sales Navigator integration](/docs/general/additional-resources/linkedin-sales-navigator), you also have the option to send a Connection or InMail.
**Automated Email:** Compose an email and schedule it to be sent automatically to your recipients at the time of your choosing. 
**Manual Email:**  [A task](/docs/campaigns/creating-campaigns/how-do-i-send-a-manual-email) will be created for this touch, located in the [Campaigns tab of the Yesware Sidebar](/docs/campaigns/creating-campaigns/how-do-i-access-my-to-do), reminding you to send the email you've composed in the Campaigns module to your recipient. 
**Call: **[A task](/docs/general/how-do-i-take-an-action-on) will be created for this touch, located in the [Campaigns tab of the Yesware Sidebar](/docs/campaigns/creating-campaigns/how-do-i-access-my-to-do), reminding you to call your recipient. At the time of the call, you will be able to log the call and its outcome.  For Enterprise plan holders, we will help you log the call to Salesforce.
**Custom Task: **[A task](/docs/general/how-do-i-take-action-on-a) will be created for this touch, located in the [Campaigns tab of the Yesware Sidebar](/docs/campaigns/creating-campaigns/how-do-i-access-my-to-do), reminding you to take any kind of action you would like. This just serves as a reminder; write yourself a note on what action you want to take: do research, social media outreach, and send swag.
