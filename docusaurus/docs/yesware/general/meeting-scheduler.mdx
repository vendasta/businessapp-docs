# Meeting Scheduler Guide

Meeting Scheduler provides reps with a complete automated workflow for booking meetings with customers and prospects, eliminating the back and forth emails in booking a meeting by creating a scheduling link you can send to your recipients, which allows them to book meetings directly on your calendar.

## Setting Up Meeting Scheduler

To set up Meeting Scheduler, open a new email message and click on the calendar icon in the Yesware Sidebar to launch the Meeting Scheduler menu. Next, click the gear icon to open up the [Meeting Scheduler settings](https://app.yesware.com/account/meeting_scheduler).

Here, you can set the stage for your meeting link, which you will send to prospects or customers to book a time on your calendar.

### Basic Settings

**Display Name:** Enter what name you want to appear when an individual goes to book a meeting with you. It will say "Book a time with *Display Name*."

**Welcome Message:** In this area, you can type out a greeting or instructions to your recipients, leave the default "book a meeting with me!" or even leave it blank, if you'd prefer.

**Meeting Link Text to Display:** This lets you insert pre-hyperlinked text into your emails. Decide how you want to present this specific scheduling link to your prospects and customers by linking a phrase. You might consider something like, "Click here to book a meeting with me."

**My Calendar Link URL:** This lets you create a custom URL that will direct your recipients to a page to book a meeting with you.

**Web Conferencing:** If you use Zoom/Microsoft Teams, you can enable our [Zoom](https://support.yesware.com/hc/en-us/articles/15420616129431-How-to-Use-Zoom-Details-in-Meeting-Scheduler-Outlook-) or Microsoft Teams integration to automatically insert your meeting link into booked meetings.

### Advanced Settings

Under "Show Advanced Settings" you'll find the following:

**Prevent Last Minute Meetings:** Use this setting to prevent your recipients from booking meetings at the last minute. You can configure a limit of minutes or hours based on your preference! For example, if it is 3:29 pm and you set your Last Minute Meeting Protection settings to one hour, your recipients would not be able to book a meeting with you until 4:30 pm. If you want a full day's notice before having a meeting booked on your calendar, enter 24 hours in this setting.

**Breathing Room:** Need time to prepare or follow up between meetings? Use this setting to give yourself a breather. For example, if you choose a 15-minute Breathing Room time, we'll make sure that you always have 15 minutes before and after any meetings.

**Working Hours:** Block off the times you are unavailable so you have complete control over who books meetings with you and when. Don't want to take meetings on Fridays? Uncheck that box.

Don't forget to save by clicking "Save Details."

## Creating Meeting Types

From here, you'll want to establish Meeting Types. Create meeting types that reflect the different meetings you routinely have – think Intro Calls (30 mins), Demos (60 mins), etc. You'll be able to send specific meeting types to your invitees or give them the option to choose from all of your meeting types. You can create as many meeting types as you'd like but try not to overwhelm them with options.

To get started, click "Create Meeting Type."

### Meeting Type Settings

**Meeting Type Name:** Here, categorize what type of meeting this will be by giving it a clear, concise name like "Demo," "Discovery Call," "Quick Connect," or "Account Review."

**Meeting Duration:** When your recipient selects this meeting type, how long do you want it to last? For example, you'd probably want to make "Quick Connect" a 15-minute-long meeting.

**Meeting Location:** Tell your recipients how to access the meeting. Enter your dial-in details, or click the "Virtual Meeting" button to select Zoom or Microsoft Teams to automatically generate a meeting link.

**Meeting Description:** Let your recipients know what this meeting will be about, including any agenda items if you have them.

**Meeting Link Text to Display:** This lets you insert pre-hyperlinked text into your emails. Decide how you want to present this specific scheduling link to your prospects and customers by linking a phrase. You might consider something like, "Click here for a product demo" if you're creating a Demo Meeting Type.

**Direct URL to Meeting:** This lets you create a custom URL that will direct your recipients to book this specific meeting type.

### Advanced Meeting Type Settings

Under "Show Advanced Settings" you'll find the following:

**Add Custom Questions:** You can request that your recipient provide additional information such as phone number or company name so that you can be fully prepared for the meeting. Add your own custom questions to get more info.

**Add to Calendar:** Choose from your owned calendars to decide on which calendar the meeting will book.

**Add Others to Meeting:** Allows you to add Colleagues to your meeting so that they will be added to the meeting when it is booked, and their schedule will be considered when presenting scheduling options to the recipient.

**Reschedule Link Settings:** A reschedule link can be found on the invitation of meetings booked through a meeting type. (As a default, all meeting types have this option checked off. Make sure to uncheck this box, if you do not wish to have a rescheduling option for your meeting type.)

**Working Hours:** Allows you to create custom working hours for the meeting type, independent of the 'Meeting Scheduler Settings.'

Finally, click "Save Meeting Type" at the bottom of the page.

## Suggesting Specific Times for Meetings

### For Outlook

**To suggest specific times for a meeting:**
- Open the Yesware Sidebar in your compose window (we highly recommend you pin the Sidebar)
- Click the "Insert Meeting Link" tab
- Choose "Select Custom Availability"

The window will load your calendar and allow you to click and drag to indicate the times you'd like to offer your recipient. Give your meeting a title and specify a meeting length, location, and description. When a recipient books the meeting, all of these fields will populate onto the calendar invite.

By default, Meeting Scheduler will display *your* calendar. Using the "Book on Calendar" drop-down, you can switch to another calendar on which you are listed as an owner. This lets you schedule meetings on those calendars.

When you have finished setting the parameters for this individual meeting, click "Share Custom Times" in the bottom left. The available time slots will then be inserted into the email message you were composing and a link the recipient can click on to schedule will be included as well. When you send this message, your recipient will be able to click the link that says "Click here to schedule a meeting." They will be brought to a landing page where they can select a specific time to meet from all the times that you have offered. Only time slots that are still available (not busy) on your calendar will be displayed on this landing page.

When a recipient selects a time, they will receive a calendar invite for the meeting, and the meeting will automatically show up on your Outlook calendar. The new calendar event will invite all the people who were on the original email in which you included the link. Any recipients on the "cc" list of the original email will be added as optional attendees.

You will also receive an email from "Yesware Meeting Scheduler" to confirm that you have a new meeting scheduled.

## How Calendar Availability Works

When you send an email that includes a Meeting Scheduler link, your recipient will be brought to a page where they can select a specific time to meet from all the times you have available (or offered in the case of Custom Availability). Only time slots that are still available (not busy) on your calendar will be displayed on that landing page.

**Yesware's Meeting Scheduler feature checks your calendar for conflicts so that it will not show recipients a time that is now unavailable.** (Meeting Scheduler connects directly with Google Calendar for Gmail users and with Outlook Calendar for Outlook users)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I add a Meeting Scheduler Link to my Campaign?

**You can add a Meeting Scheduler link to campaigns built on Gmail or Outlook.**

To use your Meeting Scheduler Link in a Campaign, find the "Meeting Link" button at the bottom of the compose area for your email touch. You can then choose if you'd like to use your general calendar link or a Custom Meeting Type. Once you select which you'd like to insert, it will add the meeting link to your Campaign Touch content, streamlining meeting booking workflows.

Once a recipient books a meeting, they will be removed from the Campaign, as this counts as a "connection" (if you've kept the default setting to remove recipients after connection).

### Is there an easy way to add my Meeting Link to a Campaign?

Yes! To use your Meeting Scheduler Link in a Campaign, find the "Meeting Link" button at the bottom of the compose area for your email touch. You can then choose if you'd like to use your general calendar link or a Custom Meeting Type. Once you select which you'd like to insert, it will add the meeting link to your Campaign Touch content, streamlining meeting booking workflows.

If your name has changed and you'd like to update it in Meeting Scheduler, follow these steps:
- Go to your **Meeting Scheduler settings**.
- Click **Edit Details**.

- If your name appears in your calendar link URL, you may also update that.
- Click **Save Details** at the bottom of the screen.

Your changes will be reflected on your scheduling page immediately.

### What happens if my recipient is out of office?
