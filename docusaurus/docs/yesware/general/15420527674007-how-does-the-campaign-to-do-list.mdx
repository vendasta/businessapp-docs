# How does the Campaign to-do list work with SFDC tasks in Gmail?

The [Campaigns to-do list](/docs/campaigns/creating-campaigns/how-do-i-access-my-to-do) is designed to help you stay on task by creating to-do cards for each manual touch type that’s currently due. Future activity is hidden from view. To-dos can be [manual emails](/docs/campaigns/creating-campaigns/how-do-i-send-a-manual-email), [phone calls](/docs/general/how-do-i-take-an-action-on), or [custom tasks](/docs/general/how-do-i-take-action-on-a).
Campaigns **do not** create tasks in Salesforce before the task is completed, but rather it syncs completed activities into SFDC tasks for that recipient for manual emails and phone calls after you have completed that touch type. This keeps SFDC up to date with the latest activity but does not overload it with incomplete tasks or activities. Yesware Campaigns has no relation to/impact on campaigns in Salesforce.
