# Missing first and last names on campaign export

Yesware's campaign export feature does not populate the First and Last Names columns in the exported CSV. These columns are included as headers, but no data is expected to appear under them. This is the intended behavior of the export function at this time.
If users wish to incorporate recipient information, including First and Last Names, into a new or existing campaign, or for record-keeping in an external program like Excel, they can follow these steps:
**1. Move Recipients to a New/Existing Campaign:**
- Select the recipients within a given campaign.
- Click on "Move To" to prompt the option to select an existing campaign or create a new one.
- By proceeding, users will see the recipients and all their previously entered information (First Name, Last Name, etc.) transferred to the Prospect List.
This allows users to move recipients into new or existing campaigns, maintaining their associated information for use with merge fields as before. 
**2. Copy and Paste Recipient Information:**
- On the Prospect List page, copy the list and paste it into an Excel sheet or another external program.Note: The pasted information might need formatting to match the desired layout.
