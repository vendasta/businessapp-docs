# Why am I receiving an open notification right after I send a tracked email?

If you are noticing that you receive open event notifications for recipients only a few seconds after sending a tracked message, your email could have gone through a recipient’s virus scanner, or your email was "pre-opened" by the recipient's email client. Note, this is a rare occurrence. 
Unfortunately, we don’t have much of a workaround as the issue is related to settings put in place by your recipient.
