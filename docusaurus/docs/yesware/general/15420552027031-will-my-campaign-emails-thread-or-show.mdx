# Will my Campaign emails thread or show as Replies?

Yes, when you create multi-touch campaigns, your prior messages will be quoted within the text you send. In addition, the messages should be threaded or shown in "conversation view" if they contain the same subject line and if "conversation view/threading" is turned on in your email client.
