# What happens if my recipient is out of office?

If we detect an Out of Office reply from a recipient in a Campaign, you'll be alerted and presented with a new task in the [Campaign sidebar](/docs/campaigns/creating-campaigns/how-do-i-access-my-to-do) with the option to reschedule the recipient’s next touch. 
To reschedule the next touch:
1. Select "Reschedule" at the bottom of the To Do card for the recipient.
2. Use the drop arrow to choose a new date on the calendar.
3. Click the blue "Set" button to finalize rescheduling the recipient's next touch.
