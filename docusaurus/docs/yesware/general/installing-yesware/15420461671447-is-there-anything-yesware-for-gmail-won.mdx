# Is there anything Yesware for Gmail won't work well with?

Yesware for Gmail was built to be used on an un-customized Gmail interface. Our tool works on the most up-to-date version of Chrome.
We are aware of some *potential* conflicts listed below:
- **Incompatible Gmail Settings:** Plain text mode,Â "Conversation View" turned off (put another way, you'll want to have Conversation View turned on.)
- **Incompatible Gmail Labs Features:** Send &amp; Archive, Multiple Inboxes by Vivi, Preview Pane, Right-side chat, SMS in chat.
- **Possible Incompatible Extensions:** FastestChrome by fastestfox.com, Gist for Chrome by BlackBerry, Ginger Software, Boomerang, Hunter, EmailTracker, Adblocker, Adblocker Plus, Ghostery, Hubspot, SalesForce or any extensions that take up space in the compose window.
- **Incompatible Operating Systems**
Yesware and other extensions make frequent updates. As such, you may notice a conflict with another extension even though it's worked fine in the past.
