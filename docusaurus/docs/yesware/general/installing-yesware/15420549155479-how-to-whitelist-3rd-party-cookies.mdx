# How to whitelist 3rd Party Cookies

Yesware relies on 3rd party cookies and localStorage for certain features, like your 'Yesware Gcal Dashboard' and allowing 3rd party cookies has long been a requirement to use Yesware. If our 3rd party cookies are blocked, then (among other things) we may misattribute tracking pixel opens from the owner of the pixel.Â 
Go to chrome://settings/cookies and select 'Allow all cookies' or 'Block third-party cookies in Incognito'
If you chose to block third party cookies, but still want to use Yesware you will need to add it to your 'List of Sites that can always use cookies'
Click on the ADD button &gt; type in [*.]yesware.com (we recommend typing it, and not copying and pasting) &gt; check the 'Including third-party cookies on this site' box&gt; ADD &gt; refresh your Gmail page.
