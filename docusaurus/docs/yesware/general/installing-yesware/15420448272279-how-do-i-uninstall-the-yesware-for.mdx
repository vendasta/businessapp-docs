### Why can't I uninstall the add-in? 
This is usually due to an admin setting that you can adjust in your Microsoft account. If you are the admin could you please make sure that users have been allowed access to the add-in? If you are not the admin, please reach out to your Admin/IT team to check the settings for you.
