# What are Global Policies?

To set account-wide policies for some of Yesware’s most popular features, you must be a Yesware **admin or account manager**.
Global Policies allow you to enable features by default for all account members, helping ensure consistent settings across your entire user base. By checking a box and clicking **"Save"** (please note, you must make these changes one at a time), the selected policy will apply organization-wide. If you need to make changes for an individual user, you can do so under that user’s **"Permissions."**
### Gmail
To access the self-service portal in Gmail:
Go to the **Yesware dropdown** at the top of Gmail.
Select **"My Account."**
Navigate to the **"Global Policies"** section in the left-hand menu.
### Outlook
To access the self-service portal in Outlook:
Select the **"Menu"** tab of the Yesware Sidebar.
Click **"Manage My Teams."**
In the far-left margin, select **"Settings."**
Then navigate to the **"Global Policies"** section in the left-hand menu.
