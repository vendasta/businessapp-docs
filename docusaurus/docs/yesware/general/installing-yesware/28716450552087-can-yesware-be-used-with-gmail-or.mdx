# Can Yesware be used with Gmail or Outlook if Gmail is configured within Outlook?

Yesware does not support the use of crossover mail servers. To utilize Yesware, you must install Yesware through your Gmail account if your email is hosted by Gmail. If you prefer to use Outlook, you'll need to purchase an Outlook email account from Microsoft and subsequently install Yesware using the Outlook account.
