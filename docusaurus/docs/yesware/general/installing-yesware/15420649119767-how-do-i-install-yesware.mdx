# How do I install Yesware?

### For Gmail Users
Installing Yesware is extremely simple and takes no more than about a minute. You can install Yesware directly from our [website](https://www.yesware.com/install). We offer a trial to all new users that can be accessed [here](http://www.yesware.com/sign-up/). Once you visit that link, click on your inbox type and then you'll need to sign into your email and grant Yesware access. It's as easy as that! If you're on our Enterprise plan, you will also need to authenticate to Salesforce (essentially sign in and grant access), and you will be prompted to do so.  
If you already have an existing account, you can use our direct install links for [Gmail](https://app.yesware.com/install). It won't overwrite your existing account; it will just ensure you go through the entire installation flow.
