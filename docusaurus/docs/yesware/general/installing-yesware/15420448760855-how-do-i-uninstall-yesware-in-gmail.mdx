Refresh Gmail
### For Firefox
*(Please note, we no longer support Firefox, so if you uninstall Yesware in your Firefox environment, you will need to reinstall it in and begin using it in Chrome)*
- Go to Tools &gt; Add-Ons (might be Firefox Menu &gt; Add-Ons depending on your version)

**Please note that uninstalling Yesware will not cancel your paid account.** Â If you'd like to cancel your paid account, you can do so by clicking [here](https://app.yesware.com/account/plan). At the bottom of the page, there will be an option to "Cancel Renewal." By default, all plans are set to automatically renew.
