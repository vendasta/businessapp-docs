# Is Yesware compatible with Outlook accounts hosted through GoDaddy?

**Yesware Compatibility with GoDaddy-Hosted Email Accounts**
At this time, Yesware does **not support email addresses hosted by GoDaddy**, even if they are accessed through the Outlook client using Microsoft’s Exchange service.
For the Yesware Outlook Add-in to work as intended, the email account must be hosted **directly through Microsoft 365 (O365)**. We recommend verifying your email hosting provider to ensure full compatibility with Yesware’s Outlook integration.
