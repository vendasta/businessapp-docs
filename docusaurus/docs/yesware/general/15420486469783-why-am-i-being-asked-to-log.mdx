# Why am I being asked to log-in to the sidebar when I try sending a tracked email using Outlook desktop?

This can occur when there are authentication issues between your email address and Yesware. To resolve, please try authenticating in your Outlook web mailbox first by doing the following: 
Open a Chrome browser, visit [Outlook.com](http://outlook.com/), sign-in to your account.
- Once logged into your mailbox, click into an email in your inbox and select the "More Actions" button (highlighted below).
​
Select Yesware &gt; open Yesware
- Log-in when prompted
Once you have successfully logged into your Outlook web application, if you close out of your Outlook desktop application and re-open it, you should then be logged into Yesware in your desktop.
If you are continuing to experience issues, reach out to [support@yesware.com](mailto:support@yesware.com).
