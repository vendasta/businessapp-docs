# Set Up and Manage Multi-Channel Campaigns

Yesware’s Campaigns feature allows you to execute multi-touch, multi-channel outreach directly from your inbox—helping you stay on task and maximize your results. You can personalize communication, track engagement, and manage tasks all in one place.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creating and Sending Your First Campaign&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
### For Gmail
Click the “Campaigns” module at the top of your inbox, then select **“New Campaign”** in the upper right.
### For Outlook
Navigate to the Add-ins section of your Outlook ribbon and click **“Open Campaigns.”** In the window that opens, click **“New Campaign.”**
******
Next, name your Campaign and add your recipients. You can:
Upload a CSV file
Manually enter data into the recipient table
Add recipients via the “Add to Campaign” button from an email thread
(Enterprise only) Import recipients from Salesforce by selecting a Contact or Lead list, searching for an individual, or using the “Add to Campaign” option in Salesforce directly
Note: You can continue adding recipients to a Campaign even after it’s been created.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Touch Types and Personalization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
You can create an unlimited number of touches in a Campaign. Recommended range is between 5–10 touches. Yesware supports the following touch types:
### Gmail Only Touch Types
**Manual Email** – Send personalized emails in real time via the Yesware Sidebar
**Custom Task** – Assign a task like sending a handwritten note or researching a lead
**Connect on Sales Navigator** – Send LinkedIn connection requests (Sales Navigator Team/Enterprise license required)
**InMail on Sales Navigator** – Send InMails via LinkedIn
### Shared Touch Types (Gmail and Outlook)
**Automated Email** – Sends at a scheduled time with no manual input
**Phone Call** – Prompts you to call, log the outcome, and syncs it to Salesforce
To personalize touches, use **merge fields**. These fields align with your CSV columns, Salesforce fields, or manually entered data. Click the **Insert Merge Field** button in the editor to drop in dynamic values. You can preview your Campaign with merged data under the **“Preview and Personalize”** tab.
Schedule your first touch by choosing a date and time. You may send it immediately or specify a future send time. Campaigns can be fully customized by touch frequency, number of touches, and timing (e.g., 8 emails spaced 2 business days apart).
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Managing Tasks with the Smart To-Do List (Gmail)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Gmail users can use the **Smart To-Do List** in the Sidebar to stay on top of manual tasks. When a task is due, it will appear in the Sidebar with options to:
**Snooze** – Delay the task to a later time
**Skip** – Bypass the current step for a recipient
**Remove** – Remove the recipient from the Campaign
Tasks can also be managed in bulk or individually in the **Manage Recipients** tab. You can filter by touch type, recipient, or domain.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Managing Campaigns and Recipients&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
From the **Campaigns dashboard**, select any Campaign to:
Edit Campaign steps
Reschedule tasks
Skip or remove individual recipients
Move recipients to another Campaign
Export recipient data for reporting
You can search across Campaigns by name, email address, or domain to take action efficiently.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sharing Campaigns with Teams&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Campaigns can be shared with your team by clicking **“Share”** at the bottom right of a Campaign. Select the appropriate team(s) to give access.
When shared:
You retain ownership and editing rights of the master Campaign
Team members can only manage their own recipients
Others can duplicate the Campaign for personal use but cannot manage your data
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Campaigns Reporting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Reporting tools help you evaluate Campaign performance and optimize your outreach. The **Campaigns by Campaign** and **Campaigns by User** reports provide data on usage and outcomes across your team.
For Enterprise users, Salesforce integration pulls contacts and leads into Yesware and syncs engagement activities (emails, calls, meetings) back into Salesforce. This enables full visibility into Campaign performance within your CRM.
