# Updating Seats For Renewal

In order to adjust the number of seats on your account for your upcoming renewal, please visit your [User Administration Page.](https://app.yesware.com/account/manage)
From here, click **Update Seats at Renewal, **and adjust seats as necessary. This will ensure that the correct number of seats are renewed and you are not charged for additional seats you don't intend to use.
