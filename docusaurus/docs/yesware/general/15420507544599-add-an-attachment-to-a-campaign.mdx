# Add an Attachment to a Campaign

To add an attachment to a Campaign, click the **"Attachment"** button at the bottom of the compose area in Campaigns.
Select the file you'd like to attach, and you will be presented with two checkboxes:
**Allow recipient to download**: This allows the recipient to download the attachment, which they can then keep or share. If they share the downloaded copy, you will not be able to track who else has seen the attachment.
**Ask the recipient to enter a name to access the presentation**: This enables more detailed analytics. If enabled, recipients will be asked to enter their name before viewing. For example, if you send the attachment to John Smith and he views it, then forwards the email to Jane Doe who also views it, the Presentation Report will show both namesâ€”assuming they enter them. Recipients may choose to skip adding their name.
Once you've made your selections, click **"Continue."** Yesware will convert your attachment to a presentation and insert it into the body of your email.
**Note:** The attachment is inserted where your cursor is placed, so make sure your cursor is in the correct location before clicking the **"Attachment"** button.
When your recipient views the attachment, a **Presentation Report** will appear in your **Tracking Activity Feed**, showing who opened it and how long they viewed it.
