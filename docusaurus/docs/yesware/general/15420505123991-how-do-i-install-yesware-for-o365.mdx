# How do I install Yesware for O365?

To install the Yesware for O365 add-in, simply visit [the Microsoft AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/product/office/WA104380259) and click "Get it Now." Once you've loaded the add-in, you may need to close and re-open Outlook. Like any Microsoft add-in, you'll need to be clicked on an email message for the add-in to appear in your inbox. If you've clicked on an email, you should see a blue Y that appears on the right-hand side of your Outlook ribbon. Clicking on that will open up the Yesware Sidebar, giving you access to Yesware's features.
