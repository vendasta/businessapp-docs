## Managing Your Subscription

### Subscription Plans

Yesware offers multiple subscription tiers with different features and limits. For a complete list of features and limits by plan, please refer to our **pricing table**.

### Updating Seats for Renewal

In order to adjust the number of seats on your account for your upcoming renewal, please visit your [User Administration Page.](https://app.yesware.com/account/manage)

From here, click **Update Seats at Renewal,** and adjust seats as necessary. This will ensure that the correct number of seats are renewed and you are not charged for additional seats you don't intend to use.

### Downgrading or Canceling

Per our terms and conditions, early cancellations, downgrades, or seat reductions are not permitted during the active term of your subscription.

Plans are set to auto-renew by default. If you disable auto-renew, your subscription will remain active until the end of the current term and will not renew afterward.

To review your current plan details, please contact your account representative.

## Email Preferences

## Okta Integration

Yesware does not provide an integration with Okta, but many Yesware customers use Okta (and other SSO systems) successfully. Yesware's primary authentication method is via OAuth to either Google or Microsoft. Typically, once a user is authenticated with Okta, they will also be authenticated with Google or Microsoft, and will be able to log in to Yesware without issue, however, user provisioning/de-provisioning within Yesware will have to be done manually, as it is not integrated with Okta.
