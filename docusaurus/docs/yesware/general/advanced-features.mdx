# Advanced Features

This guide covers advanced Yesware features and functionality that can enhance your email productivity and sales engagement workflows.

## Using the Send With Yesware Button

The "Send with Yesware" button is a feature in Outlook that allows you to send tracked and synced emails. Depending on your Outlook version and platform, you may or may not need to use this button.

### When You Need to Use the Send With Yesware Button

You will have to use the "Send with Yesware" button to track your emails if:

**If you use Outlook's Mac Desktop App:**
- We will keep you posted on when you can switch to using the Outlook send button, but at this time, it is TBD.
- Don't want to wait? Use the Outlook Web Access or reach out to support@yesware.com and ask for Direct Install.

**If you are not yet on Outlook's Version 2008 (Build 13127.21064) or above:**
- Don't want to wait? Ask your IT team to update your Outlook version, use Outlook Web Access, or reach out to support@yesware.com and ask for Direct Install.

### When You Can Use the Regular Outlook Send Button

If you use Outlook Web Access or are a PC user on Outlook Version 2008 (Build 13127.21064) or above, you can use the regular Outlook send button. However, you must:

1. **Open the Yesware sidebar** by clicking the "Open Sidebar" button in your compose window
2. **Keep the sidebar open** at the time of the message compose/send for us to insert the tracking pixel
3. **Pin the sidebar** so it's always open - just select the pushpin icon in the upper right-hand corner of the Yesware sidebar

**You will not be able to track and sync emails if you do not have the sidebar open in your compose window.**

### How to Test

A good way to test is to use the "Send with Yesware" button and see if you get a message that says to use the native send button within Outlook. If you are on a version where you use the native send button, you will want to pin the Yesware sidebar within the compose message.

## Mail Merge in Outlook

Sending a mail merge in Outlook is easy with Yesware Campaigns feature, just one part of Yesware's sales productivity add-on for O365. [Click here](https://www.yesware.com/feature/campaigns/) to learn more.

You have the ability to draft a new message in the Compose area or select one of your templates.

When creating your email content, use the column names as your merge fields, using the \{!columnname\} format.

Use the "Preview & Personalize" button to see how each email will read for your recipients.

**5. Once you are all set, finalize the mail merge by clicking "Start Campaign."**

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I have to use the Send with Yesware button to track and sync my Outlook email?

### Can I use templates with mail merge?

Yes! When creating a campaign (mail merge), you can select from your saved templates rather than drafting new content. Templates can include merge fields that will be automatically populated with recipient data from your CSV or Salesforce list.

### What's the difference between a campaign and a mail merge?

In Yesware, campaigns and mail merge are essentially the same thing. A campaign with a single automated email touch functions as a traditional mail merge, allowing you to send personalized emails to multiple recipients at once. Campaigns can also include multiple touches over time, making them more powerful than traditional mail merge.

### How many recipients can I include in a mail merge?

The number of recipients you can add to a campaign (mail merge) depends on your subscription plan. Please refer to our pricing table for specific limits.

Note that your email provider (Google or Microsoft) also has daily sending limits that may affect how quickly your campaign sends.
