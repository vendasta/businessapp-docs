# Can I downgrade my subscription?

Per our terms and conditions, early cancellations, downgrades, or seat reductions are not permitted during the active term of your subscription.
Plans are set to auto-renew by default. If you disable auto-renew, your subscription will remain active until the end of the current term and will not renew afterward.
To review your current plan details, please contact your account representative.
