# Re-install Yesware for add-in error in O365

If you are receiving the 'Add-in Error' message, follow these steps to reinstall Yesware for Office 365:
**In your O365 Inbox:**
- Click 'Get Add-ins' &gt; My add-ins &gt; Yesware - click the 3 dots and select 'Remove'
- Close Outlook
- Re-open Outlook
- Click 'Get Add-ins' &gt; search for Yesware and select 'Add'
Next, within Outlook, please go to "**File**" &gt; "**Office Account**" and click on "**Office Updates**" and in the dropdown select "**Update Now**". Then close out of Outlook completely and open it back up.
Then, open the Yesware Sidebar again and see if you are still receiving the "**Add-In Error**" message.
Please make sure to also have the Yesware Sidebar pinned open, within the New/Compose email window.
