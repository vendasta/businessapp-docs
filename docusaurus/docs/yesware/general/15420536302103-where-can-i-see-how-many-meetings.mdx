# Where can I see how many meetings have been booked as a result of a Campaign?

### Where can Gmail and Outlook users see how many meetings have been booked as a result of a Campaign?
If you'reÂ [using a Meeting Scheduler link in a Campaign](/docs/general/can-i-add-a-meeting-scheduler-link), you can view how many meetings have been booked as a result of your Campaign in your Campaigns dashboard. There is a "Meetings Booked" column that will highlight the number of meetings that were booked using the link. This will help you to better understand which Campaigns result in booked meetings and improve Campaign sequences and content to drive meetings booked. Please keep in mind, if you are not using Meeting Scheduler in the Campaign and are booking meetings in another way, we will not be able to determine whether meetings were booked as a result.
### Which meetings are included in the column?
- Only the first meeting booked per recipient in the Campaign
- Meetings booked from a Meeting Scheduler link inserted in *any* of the Campaign touches
- Meetings booked from a Meeting Scheduler link in a thread that *started* with a Campaign touch
Please note: if a recipient books a meeting with you through the Meeting Scheduler link you've included in your Campaign, this will count as a "connection" and they will be removed from the Campaign if you've left the default "Remove Recipients after Connection" setting.
