# Troubleshooting: Campaign failed to start error

When managing multiple campaigns, you may encounter a situation where one or more recipients in your current list are also active in another campaign. It's important to note that recipients cannot be active in more than one campaign at the same time. 
To resolve this issue, ensure that recipients complete their engagement in the other campaign, or you can manually remove the user from the campaign. Once this is done, you can successfully initiate the new campaign with the intended recipients.
