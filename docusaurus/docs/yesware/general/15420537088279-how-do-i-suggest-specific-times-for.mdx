# How do I suggest specific times for meetings in Outlook?

**To suggest specific times for a meeting: **
- Open the Yesware Sidebar in your compose window (we highly recommend you pin the Sidebar)
- Click the "Insert Meeting Link" tab
- Choose "Select Custom Availability"
The window will load your calendar and allow you to click and drag to indicate the times you'd like to offer your recipient. Give your meeting a title and specify a [meeting length](https://support.yesware.com/hc/en-us/articles/15420537035799), location, and description.  When a recipient books the meeting, all of these fields will populate onto the calendar invite.
By default, Meeting Scheduler will display *your* calendar. Using the "Book on Calendar" drop-down, you can switch to another calendar on which you are listed as an owner. This lets you schedule meetings on those calendars.
When you have finished setting the parameters for this individual meeting, click "Share Custom Times" in the bottom left. The available time slots will then be inserted into the email message you were composing and a link the recipient can click on to schedule will be included as well. When you send this message, your recipient will be able to click the link that says "Click here to schedule a meeting." They will be brought to a landing page where they can select a specific time to meet from all the times that you have offered. Only time slots that are still available (not busy) on your calendar will be displayed on this landing page.
When a recipient selects a time, they will receive a calendar invite for the meeting, and the meeting will automatically show up on your Outlook calendar. The new calendar event will invite all the people who were on the original email in which you included the link. Any recipients on the “cc” list of the original email will be added as optional attendees. 
You will also receive an email from "Yesware Meeting Scheduler" to confirm that you have a new meeting scheduled.
