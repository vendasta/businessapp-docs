# What are some ways to avoid spam filters when using Link Tracking?

### What are some ways to avoid spam filters when using Link Tracking on Gmail or Outlook?
Link Tracking enables you to see what content your prospects are interested in and prioritize your follow-ups by tracking when links within your email messages are clicked by the recipient. When link tracking is enabled, your links are replaced with trackable links which enable Yesware to know when the link was clicked on. Yesware then quickly redirects your recipient to the final destination.    
Some email spam filters may flag tracked links as spam because hiding the true destination of a linked message is a common tactic of what are known as phishing attacks where a bad URL is hidden behind what appears to be a legitimate URL. To lessen the chance of your email being flagged as spam by your recipient's email filters, we recommend using descriptive links. For example, use [Yesware](http://www.yesware.com/) rather than [www.yesware.com](http://www.yesware.com).
On rare occasions, the recipient’s mail filters may flag emails as spam regardless of using descriptive links. There are additional best practices which can lessen the chances of your link-tracked email being flagged as spam: click [here](https://www.yesware.com/blog/email-spam/) to learn more.
