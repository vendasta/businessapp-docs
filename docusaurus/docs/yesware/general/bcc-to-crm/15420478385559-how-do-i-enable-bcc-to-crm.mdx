# How do I enable BCC to CRM in Gmail

For Pro or Premium plan users on **Gmail**, our BCC email feature will [automatically send a copy of your emails into your CRM](https://support.yesware.com/entries/24787597-What-CRMs-do-you-support-). If your CRM provides a BCC email address or unique Dropbox address, we can send a copy of your outbound messages into the CRM via email.
In order to set up the automatic BCC to CRM feature, you will need to follow the below instructions:
- Click the "Yesware" drop-down in the left-hand corner of your inbox.
- Select "Preferences".
- Under "Integrations," scroll down to "BCC to CRM" and toggle it on.
- Enter your unique BCC address.
- Click "save &amp; reload".
- Ensure that the "CRM" button is checked at the bottom of your Gmail compose window.
Our Enterprise tier [integrates directly with Salesforce.com](https://www.yesware.com/feature/salesforce-integration/), the world’s leading CRM provider, so you do not need to use the CRM email address. Instead, you will want to authenticate your Salesforce account to set up the automatic sync.
