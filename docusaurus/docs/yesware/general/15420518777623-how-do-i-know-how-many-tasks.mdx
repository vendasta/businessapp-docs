# How do I know how many tasks I have today in my Gmail list?

Total tasks are listed in red at the top of the [Campaigns to-do list](/docs/campaigns/creating-campaigns/how-do-i-access-my-to-do). You may want to use the refresh button in the Sidebar (highlighted below) to ensure all your tasks have loaded. We will only show 500 to-do cards on the Campaigns sidebar at a time. If you have more than that, as you complete tasks, click the refresh button and the remaining tasks will begin to load.
