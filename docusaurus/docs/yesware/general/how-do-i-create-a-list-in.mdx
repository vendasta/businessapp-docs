1. Log into your Salesforce account.2. Select the Contacts or Leads tab.3. Click “Create New View.”
From there, you can set up a new view using filters and select which fields you’d like to be displayed in the list.  Please note, any of the fields you include in your Contact/Lead list will come over as column headers in the Recipients Table in Campaigns, so that you are able to pair them with merge fields and personalize your Campaigns emails.  
- Step 1: Name your list view
- Step 2: Add filters. You can filter by all Contacts/Leads or just Contacts/Leads assigned to you. Add filter logic (example: if you're reaching out to Leads in a certain industry, filter by that field)
- Step 3: Select fields to display. This will add the fields that will show in your list view in Campaigns. 
- Step 4: Click Save
Once saved, you can use the list to [add your recipients](/docs/campaigns/managing-active-campaigns#how-to-add-recipients-to-a-campaign) to a Campaign.
