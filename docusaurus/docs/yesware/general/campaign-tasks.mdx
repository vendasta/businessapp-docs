# Campaign Actions & Tasks

Yesware Campaigns include manual touch types that require you to take action at specific times. This guide covers how to complete manual email touches, phone call touches, and custom tasks effectively.

## Taking Action on Manual Email Touches

Manual email touches in Campaigns allow you to send personalized, one-to-one emails to recipients at scheduled times. Unlike automated emails, manual emails require you to review and send each message individually, giving you the flexibility to customize content based on recent interactions or context.

### How to Complete a Manual Email Touch

1. **Access your to-do list** in the Campaigns tab of the Yesware sidebar
2. When a manual email touch is due, it will appear as a to-do card
3. Click on the to-do card to open a compose window pre-populated with:
   - The recipient's email address
   - Your campaign email template with merge fields filled in
   - Any attachments or tracking settings you configured
4. **Review and customize** the email as needed
5. **Send** the email when ready

The manual email touch will be marked as complete, and the recipient will move to the next touch in your campaign sequence.

### Managing Manual Email Tasks

You can:
- **Snooze** – Delay the task to a later time
- **Skip** – Bypass the current step for a recipient
- **Remove** – Remove the recipient from the Campaign entirely

## Taking Action on Phone Call Touches

One of the available touch types in Campaigns is a Phone Call. This touch type will create a task reminding you to call your recipient. At the time of the call, you will be able to log the call and its outcome. For Enterprise plan holders, we will help you log the call to Salesforce.

### How to Complete a Phone Call Touch

To take action on a Phone Call task, you must go to the Campaigns tab of the Yesware sidebar. If you've just added Manual tasks, don't forget to refresh the sidebar. From there, select the to-do card for your Phone Call and click on the word "Call."

If your recipient has been added via Salesforce and if there is a phone number for the recipient in Salesforce, the phone number will display. If your recipient was added via CSV and you've included a "Phone" column (must be "Phone" and not "Number" or "Phone Number") with information listed, it will grab and display that phone number. Otherwise, you'd get the phone number however you would normally get a phone number to make a call.

After you've clicked on the word "Call," a box will open that includes your talking points that you put together when you created the Campaign so you can reference them when making the phone call. For Enterprise plan holders, you'll also have the Contact/Lead record at your fingertips for context.

Select the outcome of the call, which will impact whether or not the next stage of the Campaign gets sent, and add any applicable notes from the call. By clicking "Save and Log," you are saving the outcome of the call, checking the task off your to-do list in the Sidebar, and giving yourself the option to log the call to Salesforce.

For Enterprise plan holders, don't forget to hit the second "Save" button that pops up at the bottom of the Salesforce tab; this will log that call to Salesforce.

## Taking Action on Custom Tasks

Custom tasks in Campaigns allow you to create reminders for actions outside of email and phone calls. These might include:
- Sending a handwritten note
- Researching a prospect
- Connecting on social media (outside of LinkedIn Sales Navigator)
- Following up with a colleague about the prospect
- Any other custom action relevant to your sales process

### How to Complete a Custom Task

1. **Access your to-do list** in the Campaigns tab of the Yesware sidebar
2. When a custom task is due, it will appear as a to-do card with your task description
3. **Complete the task** as described (e.g., send the handwritten note, conduct research, etc.)
4. Return to the to-do card and click **"Complete"** to mark it as done

The recipient will then move to the next touch in your campaign sequence.

## Managing Your To-Do List

The Campaigns to-do list is designed to help you stay on task by creating to-do cards for each manual touch type that's currently due. Future activity is hidden from view.

### Viewing Your Tasks

Total tasks are listed in red at the top of the Campaigns to-do list. You may want to use the refresh button in the Sidebar to ensure all your tasks have loaded. We will only show 500 to-do cards on the Campaigns sidebar at a time. If you have more than that, as you complete tasks, click the refresh button and the remaining tasks will begin to load.

### Bulk Actions

You can also manage tasks in bulk or individually in the **Manage Recipients** tab of your campaign. You can filter by touch type, recipient, or domain to take action efficiently.

## Salesforce Integration

For Enterprise plan holders with Salesforce Sync enabled, completed activities are automatically logged to Salesforce:

### How It Works

Campaigns **do not** create tasks in Salesforce before the task is completed, but rather it syncs completed activities into SFDC tasks for that recipient for manual emails and phone calls after you have completed that touch type. This keeps SFDC up to date with the latest activity but does not overload it with incomplete tasks or activities.

### What Gets Synced

- **Manual Emails**: Logged as email activities in Salesforce once sent
- **Phone Calls**: Logged as call activities with outcome and notes
- **Custom Tasks**: Can be configured to sync based on your settings

Note: Yesware Campaigns has no relation to/impact on campaigns in Salesforce.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I access my campaign to-do list?

In Gmail, click the Campaigns tab in the Yesware sidebar to access your to-do list. In Outlook, open the Campaigns window from the Yesware ribbon.

### What happens if I skip a task?

Skipping a task will bypass that specific touch for that recipient and move them to the next touch in the sequence. The skipped touch will not be sent or completed.

### Can I reschedule a task for later?

Yes, use the "Snooze" option on any manual task to delay it to a later time. You can choose from preset time options or set a custom time.

### How do I know if a task has been completed?

Completed tasks disappear from your to-do list and the recipient's status updates to show they've progressed to the next touch. You can also view completed activity in the Manage Recipients tab of your campaign.

### What's the difference between "Skip" and "Remove"?

- **Skip**: Bypasses the current touch but keeps the recipient in the campaign, moving them to the next touch
- **Remove**: Completely removes the recipient from the campaign so they won't receive any future touches
