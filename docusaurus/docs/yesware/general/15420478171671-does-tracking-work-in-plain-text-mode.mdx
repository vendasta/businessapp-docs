# Does tracking work in plain-text mode?

No—**Yesware tracking does not work in plain-text mode**. Because Yesware’s email tracking relies on an **invisible image-based pixel**, plain-text emails (which strip all formatting and images) will **disable** tracking entirely.
To ensure your emails are tracked, you must send them using **HTML or rich text formatting**.
### Gmail
To disable plain-text mode in Gmail:
Open a new **compose window**.
Click the **three stacked dots** in the toolbar (next to the trash icon).
**Uncheck** **"Plain Text Mode."**
### Outlook
To ensure tracking works in Outlook, make sure your compose window is set to use **HTML format**, not plain text.
