# Can I install Yesware on a shared Mailbox?

Yesware integrates with your email account using Single Sign-On (SSO), which ensures that the add-in works exclusively with the email address you used to sign up for the service.
If you use shared mailboxes, the Yesware add-in may not function as expected when composing or viewing emails. Specifically, the add-in is designed to work only with the primary email address and inbox associated with your Yesware account.
### What This Means for Shared Mailbox Users
- Emails created or opened using a shared mailbox will not be compatible with the Yesware add-in.
- To use Yeswareâ€™s features, ensure you are working from the primary email address linked to your Yesware account.
