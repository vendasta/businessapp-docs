# How do I remove a recipient from a Campaign?

### Remove active recipients from a campaign
By default, recipients will automatically be removed from a Campaign if:
- you've selected the "Remove recipients after connection" setting, and
they have replied to your Campaigns email or you mark that you caught them on the [phone](/docs/general/how-do-i-take-an-action-on)
- or they have booked a meeting through your [Meeting Scheduler](/docs/general/can-i-add-a-meeting-scheduler-link) link
If for some reason you need to manually remove a recipient from a Campaign, first use the Search bar at the top right of the Campaigns dashboard to search by name, email, or domain across all of your Campaigns if you're not sure which Campaign they would be on. 
Once your recipient appears, click on the **name** **of the Campaign** that they are on and you'll be brought to the Manage Recipients view. From there, select the check box next to the name of the recipient and click the "Remove" button in the menu above. Confirm.
Alternatively, if you already know which Campaign your recipient is on, find that Campaign in your dashboard and click the More Actions kebab menu, then select the "Manage Recipients" option that appears.
This will then take you to the Manage Recipients view. You can either scroll through to find the recipient you'd like to remove or use the search bar on this page to find them. Once you do, select the check box next to the name of the recipient and click the "Remove" button in the menu above.
To remove multiple recipients at one time, simply select multiple check boxes before clicking "Remove." Their status will then change to MANUALLY REMOVED.
**NOTE:** If the REMOVE button is greyed out, check the 'Status' of the recipient. The remove button work by removing ACTIVE recipients from the campaign's sequences. The RECIPIENTS tab is a log of every recipient that was added to the campaign at some point.
