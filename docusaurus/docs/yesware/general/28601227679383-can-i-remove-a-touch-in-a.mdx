# Can I remove a touch in a campaign?

**To remove or add touches to a campaign with active recipients**, you will first need to make the campaign inactive. The workaround is to manually remove all recipients from the campaign, allowing you to edit the touches. Follow these steps:
- **Navigate to the Campaign** you want to edit.
- Click on the **Recipients** tab.
- Select the checkbox next to **Personal Details** (this will select all recipients in the campaign).
- Click **Remove** to remove all recipients.**Note:** Once recipients are removed, the campaign is effectively inactive
- Click on **Edit Campaign** to make changes.
- Scroll to **Touch 3** (or the touch you want to remove).
- Click **Remove This Touch**.
- Donâ€™t forget to click **Save &amp; Exit** to save your changes.
