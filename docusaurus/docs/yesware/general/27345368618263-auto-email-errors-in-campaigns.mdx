# Auto-Email Errors in Campaigns

Automatic email errors in Campaigns can occur when Yesware loses its connection with your email client. Use the appropriate instructions below based on your email platform.
### Outlook: Auto-Email Error – "Unspecified Error"
If you're seeing an “Unspecified Error” in Outlook Campaigns, follow these steps to reset your connection:
In your **Outlook Inbox**, open the **Yesware Sidebar**.
Select the **Menu** tab.
Scroll down and click **Sign out** where it says *"Logged in As."*
A new activation window will appear. Re-sign in using your **Microsoft credentials**.
Then:
Go to [app.yesware.com](https://app.yesware.com).
Click your **email address** in the top right-hand corner.
Select **Log out**, then log back in when prompted.
After completing these steps, return to your Campaign and click **“Try Again”** on the error message.
### Gmail: Multiple Automatic Email Errors
If you encounter multiple automatic email errors in Gmail Campaigns, it often means your Gmail client needs to **reconfirm identity permissions with Yesware**.
To resolve this:
Contact **support@yesware.com** for assistance with reconnecting your Gmail account.
