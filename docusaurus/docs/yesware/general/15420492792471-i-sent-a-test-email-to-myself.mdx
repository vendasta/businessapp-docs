# I sent a test email to myself and don’t see any tracking - why not?

To test email tracking, we recommend sending an email to [test@yesware.com.](mailto:test@yesware.com) When you compose the email, be sure you have your Yesware Sidebar open or are using the **Send with Yesware** button if you do not qualify to use the [regular Outlook send button](/docs/general/track-sync-emails-without-the-send-with). Our test recipient will open your email and you should see a new tracking event in your Yesware activity feed within a few seconds.
As we don’t track when you open your own email, **sending a tracked email to yourself won’t trigger a tracking event**; however, if you still want to test tracking in a way you feel that you have more control over, send an email to yourself at an alternative email address. Then check that email on your mobile device, but **use Data instead of WiFi**. If you check the email on the same WiFi network, we will assume it is you opening the email and not providing you with an open notification, so using Data allows you to bypass that. 
If you are still experiencing issues with tracking please reach out to [support@yesware.com](mailto:support@yesware.com).
