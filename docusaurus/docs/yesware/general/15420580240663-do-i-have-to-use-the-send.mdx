# Do I have to use the Send with Yesware button to track and sync my Outlook email?

You may be on a version of Outlook that requires you to use the "Send with Yesware" button in the upper right side of your compose window to track an email.
A good way to test is to use the "Send with Yesware" button and see if you get a message that says to use the native send button within Outlook. If you are on a version where you use the native send button, you will want to [pin the Yesware sidebar](/docs/general/track-sync-emails-without-the-send-with) within the compose message. This sidebar will need to be open at the time of the message compose/send for us to insert the tracking pixel. 
### You will have to use the "Send with Yesware" button to track your emails
If you use Outlook’s Mac Desktop App
- We will keep you posted on when you can switch to using the Outlook send button, but at this time, it is TBD.
- Don’t want to wait? Use the Outlook Web Access or reach out to support@yesware.com and ask for Direct Install.
If you are not yet on Outlook's Version 2008 (Build 13127.21064) or above
Don’t want to wait? Ask your IT team to update your Outlook version, use Outlook Web Access, or reach out to [support@yesware.com](mailto:support@yesware.com) and ask for [Direct Install.](/docs/general/track-sync-emails-without-the-send-with)
