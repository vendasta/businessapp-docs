# Why can't I accept Yesware permissions?

If you are having trouble accepting permissions, try scrolling down to the bottom. The scrollbar in this panel is very subtle (sometimes even invisible), but if you hover over the dialogue box and scroll using your mouse, trackpad, or keyboard (press up/down arrows), you should be able to click the blue "Accept" button.
