# Why am I not able to see all the recipients who have opened my email?

**Why am I not able to see all the recipients who have opened my email? (Outlook and Gmail users)**
If you send an e-mail to multiple recipients (whether it is in the TO, CC, or BCC fields), you will receive a notification that "somebody" opened your e-mail when any one person on the email opens it.
This is because our tracking, like the majority of email tracking tools, works by embedding a unique pixel at the bottom of the message. Once the email is viewed, the pixel is loaded, and we record an "open event."
We are able to record the date, time, device, and IP address, but if there are several recipients, we would not be able to define which specific recipient (email address or name) viewed the message. This is because everyone receives the same message with the same tracking data contained within it. If knowing exactly when a specific recipient opens an email is a priority, the recommendation would be to send the email directly/solely to each recipient you would like to specifically track.
