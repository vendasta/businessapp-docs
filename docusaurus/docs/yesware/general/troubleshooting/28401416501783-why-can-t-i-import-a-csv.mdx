# Why can't I import a CSV file?

If you encounter an error while trying to import a CSV file into a campaign, follow these steps to troubleshoot the issue.Â 
This issue might occur if the CSV file is saved as **"CSV UTF-8 (Comma delimited)"**. Although the file ends with **.CSV**, it is different from the **"CSV (Comma delimited)"** format.
### How to Resolve
- Open your CSV file in **Excel** or a similar program.
- When saving the file, choose the option to save it as a **"CSV (Comma delimited)"** file.
- After saving it in the correct format, try importing the file again. This should resolve the error.
By using this method, you should be able to import your recipient lists without encountering the issue.
