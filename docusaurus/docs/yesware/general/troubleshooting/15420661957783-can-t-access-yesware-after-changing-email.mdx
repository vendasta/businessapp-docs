# Can't access Yesware after changing email address

### Problem
The email address has changed and I need to access Yesware with the new email address.
### Solution 
Please reach out to [support@yesware.com](mailto:support@yesware.com) requesting you would like to transfer your Yesware license from your old email address to your new email address. (Let the Yesware agent know if you'd like your Personal Template folder migrated over as well.)
**Note that email address is our unique identifier, so we are unable to transfer historical tracking information, Campaigns (as data), and Reminders.  **
