# Activity Tab not Updating with Recent Event Activities In Gmail

**Problem**
Not receiving tracking notifications
**Solution**
Confirm if there is recent activity in your tracking report on the app site ([www.app.yesware.com](http://www.app.yesware.com)). You can confirm by sending a test email to [test@yesware.com](mailto:test@yesware.com) to see if it appears in the tracking report or not. 
**If recent events ARE in the tracking report, then**
- Check that your pop-up notification settings are enabled
- Check the list of extensions to see if there is a conflict
- Check that you are not blocking cookies
- Clear the cache/local storage
- Check the console logs for any specific errors 
**Step 1 - Check that Pop-up Notifications are enabled**
Click Yesware &gt; Preferences &gt; Notifications &gt; Event Notifications toggle "on" &gt; Save &amp; Reload
**Step 2 - Check for conflicting extensions**
In your Chrome address bar type: chrome://extensions/
- Remove any extensions that have similar functionality to Yesware including alternative email tracking tools (specifically Boomerang, Hunter, EmailTracker), any extensions that block pop-ups (Adblocker, Adblocker Plus, Ghostery), other outreach productivity tools (Specifically Hubspot, SalesForce), and anti-virus add-ins (McAfee, Norton)
- Log out and log back into your Gmail inbox 
**Step 3 - Check that you are not blocking any cookies**
- When in Chrome, at the top right, click More Settings
- At the bottom, click Advanced
- Under "Privacy and security," click "Site settings"
- Click "Cookies"
- Toggle the switch for Block third-party cookies to Off
- Be sure to have Yesware.com listed as one of the sites under your Allow tab
- Refresh Gmail
**Step  4 - Clear cache and local storage**
Clear Cache:
- Open a new tab in Chrome and enter chrome://settings/clearBrowserData into the address bar
- Set the drop-down to "the beginning of time" and only check off the "cached images + files, and hosted app data" options
- Refresh Gmail
Clear Local Storage:
- In Chrome, click the 3-horizontal-line button in the top-right of your window, next to the address bar
- Go to More Tools &gt; Developer Tools
- Make sure you're on the "console" tab of the pane that appears
- At the bottom, next to the "&gt;" symbol, type in the following exactly as I have it formatted here: localStorage.clear()
- Press enter/return &gt; that should give you "undefined"
**Step 5 - Gather console logs and send them to support@yesware.com with details of the issue**
Browser Console Logs:
- In the top right of Chrome, click on the menu button (3 horizontal lines or 3 vertical dots)
- Click on More Tools
- Developer Tools
- Click on Console
- Copy the errors or take a screenshot (copy preferred)
Background Console Logs:
- In a new tab, Visit chrome://extensions/
- Enable developer mode
- Click on the link of your background page (at "Inspect views")
- The developer console opens for this page
- Copy the errors or take a screenshot
**If recent events are NOT in the tracking report **
- Check you have the tracking box check off in your compose window
- Check for extension conflicts
- Check that you are on the most recent update of Chrome
- Clear the cache and local storage while also reinstalling Yesware (uninstall before you clear the cache/local storage and reinstall afterwards)
- Gather console logs for any specific errors or for escalation 
**Step 1 - Check that tracking box is checked**
Open a compose window and see that the tracking box is checked. 
-  If you are not seeing these options in your compose window toolbar, please see that you have enabled the Yesware compose toolbar "on" in your Yesware preferences by clicking the Yesware icon in your toolbar &gt; Preferences &gt; Inbox &gt; toggle Compose Toolbar to "on" &gt; Save &amp; Reload
**Step 2 - Check for conflicting extensions**
In your Chrome address bar type: chrome://extensions/ 
- Remove any extensions that have similar functionality to Yesware including alternative email tracking tools (specifically Boomerang, Hunter, EmailTracker), any extensions that block pop-ups (Adblocker, Adblocker Plus, Ghostery), other outreach productivity tools (Specifically Hubspot, SalesForce), and anti-virus add-ins (McAfee, Norton)
- Log out and log back into your Gmail inbox 
**Step 3 - Check that you are on the most recent version of Chrome**
- Type chrome://settings/help into your chrome address bar 
- When on this page, make sure a blue checkmark appears indicating you are on the most recent version of Chrome
**Step 4 - Clear cache and local storage in Chrome**
Clear Cache:
- Open a new tab in Chrome and enter chrome://settings/clearBrowserData into the address bar
- Set the drop-down to "the beginning of time" and only check off the "cached images + files, and hosted app data" options
- Refresh Gmail
