# Why Are My Yesware Icons Grayed Out in Outlook?

When Yesware icons appear grayed out in your Outlook interface—either in the toolbar or while composing an email—it typically means the add-in is inactive or disabled. This guide walks you through common causes and step-by-step solutions for both the inbox and the compose window.
### Scenario 1
** Yesware Icon Grayed Out in the Outlook Toolbar**
If the Yesware icon is grayed out in your main Outlook toolbar:
**Activate the Add-In**
**Single-click** an email in your inbox. The Yesware add-in only activates when a message is selected.
Make sure your **Reading Pane** is enabled and set to either **Right** or **Bottom** (not Off).
Once the Yesware sidebar appears, click the **Pin icon** to keep it active for easier access.
### Scenario 2
**Yesware Icons Grayed Out in the Compose Window**
If icons like **“Send with Yesware,” “Add Template,” “Meeting Scheduler,”** or **“Open Yesware”** are unavailable when composing an email, follow these steps:
**Step 1: Remove Conflicting Add-ins**
Conflicts with other COM add-ins can disable Yesware’s functionality.
Save your email as a **Draft**, then close and re-open the message.
Check for and disable any conflicting add-ins, such as:
**GlobalMeet**
**ToDoist**
**Boomerang**
**EmailTracker**
**Antivirus Add-ins** (e.g., McAfee, Norton, Spyware tools)
**Step 2: Re-authenticate with Yesware**
Click the **Yesware** button in your Outlook toolbar.
In the sidebar, go to the **Menu** tab and select **Sign Out**.
A login window will prompt you to **re-activate** your Yesware account.
**Step 3: Reinstall the Yesware Add-in**
Click the **Get Add-ins** icon (top-right corner of Outlook).
Go to **My Add-ins**.
Find Yesware, click the **three dots**, and select **Remove**.
Return to the add-ins menu, search for **Yesware**, and re-add it.
