# Why isn't link tracking working?

### Why isn't link tracking working in Gmail or Outlook?
You can verify that a link is going to be tracked by hovering over the hyperlinked URL or text and seeing that the destination includes "[https://t.yesware.com/tl.....](https://t.yesware.com/tl.....)".
If you're not seeing this behavior, it may be that you haven't enabled link tracking yet. To enable Link Click Tracking, click the Yesware drop-down menu in the top left corner of Gmail. From there, select Preferences and go to the "Tracking" section where you can toggle on "Track Links."  Once you've enabled it, anytime you insert a hyperlink, it will be converted to a trackable link automatically.
**Best Practice:** We recommend naming your links rather than leaving them as a URL (For example: naming the link "[Yesware](https://support.yesware.com/hc/en-us/articles/www.yesware.com) instead of "[www.yesware.com](http://www.yesware.com/)). This decreases the chances of your message being marked as spam.
