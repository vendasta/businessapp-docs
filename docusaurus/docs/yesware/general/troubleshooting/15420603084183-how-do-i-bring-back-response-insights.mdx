# How do I bring back Response Insights in the Yesware sidebar?

If you are on our Enterprise plan, within the Yesware sidebar on the right side of Gmail you'll have access to Contacts, Salesforce, Campaigns, and LinkedIn. If you'd like to bring Response Insights back, you can do this by disabling the LinkedIn sidebar. 
This can be done by following the steps below: 
- Click Yesware (top left of Gmail)
- Click Preferences
- Click Integrations, scroll down to LinkedIn Sales Navigator and toggle OFF
- Click Save &amp; Reload to reload Gmail and the Sidebar
