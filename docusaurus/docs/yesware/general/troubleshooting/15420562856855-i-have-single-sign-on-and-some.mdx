# I have Single Sign On and some features of Yesware are not functional

If you use a single sign-on service, the token that is used in place of your credentials may not be refreshing, which can cause some functions of Yesware to go offline since it no longer has complete access. In both Gmail and Outlook, you can simply log out of your Gmail or Outlook  account and then sign back in to refresh the token. 
If you are still experiencing issues, we recommend temporarily disabling your SSO and logging back into Gmail or Outlook respectively.
