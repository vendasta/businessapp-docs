## What is exporting campaign analytics?
Exporting campaign analytics lets you download the rows that appear in a campaign’s analytics table (for example, engagement such as opened or clicked) to a CSV file so you can review or process the data outside the app.

## Why is exporting important?
- Share results with your team
- Back up engagement data
- Build lists for follow-up or enrichment in other tools

## What’s included in an export?
- The export contains the rows currently visible in the campaign analytics table
- Columns in the table are included in the CSV
- If the table lists multiple events for a contact, the CSV may include more than one row for that contact

:::warning
Export limit: Campaign analytics exports are limited to 10,000 rows per export. Date and user filters are not available in this table. If your dataset is larger, use the workarounds below.
:::

## How to export within the limit
1. Open the campaign you want to review.
2. Go to the analytics table for the campaign.
3. Apply any available filters to reduce the results (for example, `Email activity: Opened`).
4. Select `Export` and download the CSV.

:::info
If you only need unique emails, deduplicate the `Email` column after you download the CSV using your spreadsheet tool’s remove-duplicates feature.

## Workarounds for datasets over 10,000 rows
When you need more than 10,000 rows or need filters that are not supported in the campaign analytics table, try these options:

- Segment first in CRM contacts
  - Filter your contacts using campaign engagement fields (for example, last campaign sent name or last campaign clicked date).
  - Export contacts from CRM and deduplicate as needed.
- Run multiple, narrower exports
  - Apply different engagement filters (such as opened vs. clicked) and export each set separately, then combine the CSVs and remove duplicates.
- Ask Support for a full export
  - If you cannot access the data you need due to the export cap, submit a support ticket and include the campaign name and the audience you need.
