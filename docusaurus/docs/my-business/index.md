The **My Business** section offers a comprehensive suite of tools designed to streamline operations efficiently.

## How does the My Business page work?

Log into Business App and click on the desired navigation. Each navigation is described below:

### Business Profile
The Business Profile page is an important component of your business's digital presence. It allows you to update all of your relevant business information such as hours, location, and phone number, and keep that information in sync across the platform, and the web.

NOTE: The Business Profile stays in sync across products. The Business Profile is also accessible from other products if they are active on the account, and editing the profile in one place will update it everywhere.

From Orders, you can:

   * Review contract start and expiration dates.
   * Review the price and items tied to the order.
   * Download a CSV of order details.
