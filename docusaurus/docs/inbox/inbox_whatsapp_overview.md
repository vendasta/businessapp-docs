## What is the Whatsapp Integration?

WhatsApp integration in Inbox enables international customer communication by connecting your WhatsApp Business account directly to your team’s shared Inbox. This allows you to send messages to new leads and existing customers using WhatsApp, while managing all customer interactions from one centralized location.

If enabled, businesses can use approved message templates to start conversations, and respond to inbound messages through the WhatsApp channel. This integration supports lead generation, faster follow-ups, and more convenient engagement—especially for customers outside the U.S. and Canada. 

WhatsApp messaging is available in Inbox, for any accounts with either Inbox Pro or AI-Assisted Web Chat products active on their account, internationally.

## Why is Whatsapp Important?

For many international markets, WhatsApp is the preferred method of communication. Without this integration, businesses may miss out on leads who prefer to message over WhatsApp instead of SMS or email. Connecting a WhatsApp Business account ensures that customers can reach you where they’re most active, while enabling your team to respond using the same shared Inbox they use for all other channels.

## How to Use It

- Once connected, you can send outbound WhatsApp messages using approved message templates.

- Additional templates can be created and submitted via the [Meta Business Help Center](https://business.facebook.com/latest/whatsapp_manager/message_templates).
- Custom replies are only allowed within 24 hours of a customer’s inbound message.

## Optional Features or Upgrades

  To verify your business, visit the [WhatsApp Manager](https://business.facebook.com/latest/whatsapp_manager).

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

**Can a client connect an existing WhatsApp business account to Inbox, and still use the mobile app?**  
Not currently. WhatsApp is working on a feature called “WhatsApp Coexistence,” which is in closed beta. If a business has a WhatsApp for business account on their phone already, they can register a new (second) account for using with Inbox. In the future, we hope to support ‘coexistence’ as well.

**Why can’t I write an outgoing message?**  
Only approved templated messages can be sent as outbound cold messages. Once a customer initiates contact, you can reply with custom messages within a 24-hour window.

**Why did my message fail to send?**  
Your message template may not be approved. Check template status in the [WhatsApp Manager](https://business.facebook.com/latest/whatsapp_manager/message_templates).

**What will WhatsApp messaging cost me?**  
You can send 250 (or 1,000 once verified) outbound conversations per month at no charge. Beyond that, Meta’s conversation pricing applies. A valid payment method must be added to your Meta account.
