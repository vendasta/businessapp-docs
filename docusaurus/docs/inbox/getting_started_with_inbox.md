> **Tip:** You don’t have to do everything at once—start with the channels you use most, and add more when you’re ready.

### Common Questions

**Can I connect more channels later?**  
Yes! You can always add or remove channels in `Inbox Settings` as your needs change.

**Do I need technical help to connect these channels?**  
Most connections are designed to be self-serve, but you’ll find a detailed guide for each one.

## 2. Invite Your Team (Optional)

Inbox works even better when your team collaborates!

To add team members so they can answer messages and help manage leads:

- Go to `Settings > Team Members`
- Click “Invite Member” and enter their email address
- Choose their role and permissions
- Send the invitation

## 3. Customize Your Notifications

Make sure you’re notified right away when a new lead or message arrives:

- Go to `Settings > Notifications`
- Select how you want to be notified (email, SMS, or in-app)
- Choose which notifications you want to receive (new messages, new leads, missed conversations)

## 4. What Happens Next?

After setup, all new messages from your connected channels will flow into Inbox.

You can:

- View and reply to all customer messages from one place
- Assign conversations to team members
- Track lead details and contact info automatically
