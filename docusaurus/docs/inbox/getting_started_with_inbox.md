You don’t have to do everything at once—start with the channels you use most, and add more when you’re ready.

## 3. Customize Your Notifications 

Make sure you’re notified right away when a new lead or message arrives! You can set-up your notification preferences to make sure you're getting email and app notifications for Inbox conversations.

- Click on <NotificationsIcon /> `Notifications` in the top-left followed by <SettingsIcon /> `Settings`
- Scroll down to the `Inbox` section and choose which notifications you want to receive. We reccommend both new messages and new leads! 
 
## 4. Invite Your Team 

Inbox works even better when your team collaborates! All of your team members are able to see the same messages from Inbox and can see who is messaging and responding to your customers.

To add team members so they can answer messages and help manage leads:

- Click on your profile icon in the top-right of the navigation
- Click “Invite Member” 
- Enter your teammates email address and choose their role and permissions
- Send the invitation

## 5. What Happens Next?

After setup, all new messages from your connected channels will flow into Inbox.

You and your team can:

- View and reply to all customer messages from one place
- Track lead details and contact info automatically
- Assign your AI Receptionist to automatically respond on supported channels
