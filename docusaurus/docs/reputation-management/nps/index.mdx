The **Net Promoter Score (NPS)** feature in Reputation AI Premium allows you to send customer satisfaction surveys before requesting public reviews. This workflow helps identify unhappy customers early, enabling businesses to address concerns before prompting reviews on platforms like Google Business Profile or Facebook.

Using NPS surveys improves feedback accuracy and increases the likelihood of receiving positive public reviews. It also supports internal service improvement by highlighting satisfaction trends.

## Why use NPS?

Sending direct review requests to all customers may result in negative public feedback, especially from dissatisfied clients. NPS surveys offer a buffer—letting you gather private feedback first. By identifying and responding to detractors privately, you reduce the risk of negative public reviews and strengthen your overall online reputation.

- Email and SMS NPS survey capabilities
- Configurable NPS templates using a drag-and-drop email builder
- Automatic redirect options for promoters to leave public reviews
- NPS score tracking and feedback history

## How to View NPS Feedback

## NPS Calculation and Trends

**NPS Formula:**

NPS = % Promoters - % Detractors

- **Promoters** are likely to recommend your business.
- **Detractors** are not likely to recommend your business.
- **Passives** are neutral and not included in the calculation.

The `Trends` section shows NPS score changes over time, helping you track improvements or issues in customer satisfaction.
