## Understanding the Listings Tab

### Primary Listings

The **Primary Listings** tab is your command center for managing your business listings. Here you can:

- **Review your Listing Score** and compare it to industry averages across different regions
- **Monitor your business listings** for accuracy and detect possible errors
- **Navigate to source platforms** to view or edit listings directly
- **Refresh listings** to get the most up-to-date information
- **Mark listings as correct** to ignore false error alerts
- **Verify as the only listing** for a source to prevent duplicate results
- **Remove incorrect matches** that don't belong to your business

### How Your Listing Score Works

Your **Listing Score** is an evaluation of your business's accurate Primary Listings and Citations. Each listing source is assigned a score based on the platform's popularity and authority. For example, having an accurate listing on Google Maps carries more weight than smaller directory sites.

**How to Increase Your Listing Score:**
- Ensure your business information is accurate and consistent across all platforms
- Add your business to additional relevant listing sources
- Fix any detected errors in existing listings
- Maintain up-to-date business information

## Understanding Citations

**Citations** are mentions of your business name along with other business data (phone number, address, website, etc.). They're crucial for search marketing optimization and help people discover your business.

Search engines consider these factors when ranking listings:
- Number of citations
- Accuracy and consistency of data in citations  
- Authority of websites where citations appear

## How the System Identifies Relevant Listings

Reputation Management uses **Best Match** – an algorithm that determines if a listing belongs to your business profile. Best Match compares your anchor data (Name, Address, Phone Number, and Website) to information found on listings and ranks them based on similarity.

The system weighs different data types with varying importance:
- **Phone Number**: 1.00 (highest weight)
- **Address**: 0.70
- **Zip Code**: 0.55
- **Business Name**: 0.55
- **City**: 0.10 (lowest weight)

A listing must reach a minimum threshold score (typically 50%) to be considered a potential match.

## Key Management Tasks

### Editing and Updating Listings

**Mark this Listing as Correct**: Use this when the system flags an error that isn't actually incorrect. This tells Reputation Management to stop checking for changes on that listing.

**Verify as Only Listing**: Use this to mark a listing as correct and prevent the system from finding additional results for that source.

**Remove Match**: Use this to remove listings that don't belong to your business.

### Adding New Listings

You can manually add listings by:
1. Going to **Listings tab > Primary Listings**
2. Finding the platform you want to add
3. Clicking **View Possible Matches**
4. Submitting your listing URL

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

<details>
<summary>How is the point-based Listing Score calculated?</summary>

Each listing source is assigned a score based on its popularity and authority. Popular sites like Google Maps carry more weight. We assess the accuracy of your listings on the top 30 sites and adjust the score accordingly:
- Good match = 100% of assigned points 
- Partial Match = Partial assigned points 
</details>

<details>
<summary>Why was my listing not found?</summary>

There are several reasons why a listing might not be found:
- **For new listings**: If you recently created a listing, Reputation Management should pull it in during its next search.
- **For Google Maps listings**: The Business Profile information may not match closely enough.
- **For service area businesses**: If your Google Maps address is suppressed, authenticating your Google Business Profile can help.

**Solution:** Manually add the listing through **View Possible Matches**.

<summary>What is the difference between Relaxed and Strict listing settings?</summary>

**Relaxed Visibility** means listings are marked as "Correct" when an exact match OR a close match is found (e.g., "St." instead of "Street").

**Strict Visibility** means online listings are marked as "Found" only when an exact match is discovered. Strict Visibility is optimal for SEO.

1. Open **Reputation Management**
