# Connecting LinkedIn Ads to Advertising Intelligence

Connect your LinkedIn Ads account to Advertising Intelligence to view insights into your LinkedIn Ads campaign performance.

4. **Review and Grant Permissions:** Follow the on-screen instructions to connect and grant Advertising Intelligence the necessary permissions to access your LinkedIn Ads data.

## Accessing Your LinkedIn Ads Data

Once the connection is established, your LinkedIn Ads campaign metrics are available within Advertising Intelligence. Here's where to find them:

- **All Tab:** Consolidated data for all your connected advertising platforms, including LinkedIn Ads, is accessible under the "All" tab.

- **Dedicated LinkedIn Ads Tab:** Advertising Intelligence also provides a separate tab specifically showcasing your LinkedIn Ads campaign statistics.

This consolidated and dedicated view of your LinkedIn Ads data helps you analyze campaign performance within Advertising Intelligence, alongside data from your other connected advertising platforms.

At this time, this feature does not fully support complete white labelling. While creating a connection for LinkedIn Ads, the permissions page will still display **Advertising Intelligence** even if this was customized to display different text.
