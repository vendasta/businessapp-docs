## Accessing Your LinkedIn Ads Data

- **All** tab: Consolidated data for all your connected advertising platforms, including LinkedIn Ads, is accessible under the **All** tab.

- **LinkedIn Ads** tab: Advertising Intelligence also provides a separate **LinkedIn Ads** tab that showcases your LinkedIn Ads campaign statistics.

This consolidated and dedicated view of your LinkedIn Ads data helps you analyze campaign performance within Advertising Intelligence, alongside data from your other connected advertising platforms.
