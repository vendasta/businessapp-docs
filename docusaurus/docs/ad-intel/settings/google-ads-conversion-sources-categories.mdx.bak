# Settings for Google Ads Conversion Sources and Categories

Google Ads conversion has a selector card that lets you select the metrics you want to track for sources and categories.

Edit these options by opening Advertising Intelligence, then navigate to **Settings > Conversion Metrics** under Google Ads. Select any of the listed metrics to start monitoring.
