Businesses may have ad campaigns spread out across different Facebook Ad accounts. In Advertising Intelligence, monitor, manage, navigate, and keep track of all your client's ad campaigns and accounts. Total impressions, clicks, and conversions display in the Executive Report. Plus, with **Advanced Reporting** enabled, access metrics for all campaigns under each connected account, making it easier to prove performance and ROI to clients.
