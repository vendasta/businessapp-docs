Partners can customize conversion setting attributions and view form fill details for their LocalAds campaigns within Advertising Intelligence.

## What is the benefit of customizing conversion setting attributes?

Show clients proof of performance for their LocalAds campaigns directly in Advertising Intelligence. Import one or all of your LocalAds campaigns to see detailed reporting and key metrics.

Customize your conversion attributions to align your reporting with your client's goals. Choose whether phone calls, store visits, and form fills count toward your total conversions.

View form fill details to identify and contact leads. See who completed the form, their contact information, and any comments they left.

## How does customizing conversion setting attributes work?

After connecting your LocalAds campaign in Advertising Intelligence, a drop-down box appears on the **Settings** page where you can select or deselect conversion attributions. Choose whether to track phone calls, visits, and form fills and count them as conversions. By default, all three are selected and tracked. Only phone calls longer than 30 seconds count as conversions.

To view form fills, click on an individual LocalAds campaign. In the table at the bottom of the page, click the **Form Fills** tab. This shows the name of who filled out the form, along with their phone number, email, message, any comments they left, and the date and time.

## What is LocalAds?

LocalAds is a premium advertising technology that offers sophisticated targeting and location-based display ads. You can combine LocalAds with other platforms such as search, social, and video depending on your client's goals and spend.

LocalAds predicts both offline and online behaviors to serve ads that produce more impressions, clicks, and return for your clients. It starts when a customer enters an identified blueprint location and LocalAds captures the device ID of their mobile phone. From there, LocalAds tracks the consumer throughout their digital and physical customer journey.
