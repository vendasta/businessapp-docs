## How does customizing conversion setting attributes work?

### Customize conversion attributions

**Step 1: Access conversion settings** - Connect the LocalAds campaign in Advertising Intelligence. A drop-down box appears on the **Settings** page with options to select or deselect conversion attributions.

**Step 2: Select conversion types** - Choose whether to track phone calls, visits, and form fills and count them as conversions. By default, all three are selected and tracked. Only phone calls longer than 30 seconds are counted as conversions.

## What is LocalAds?

LocalAds provides location-based display advertising with targeting capabilities. You can combine LocalAds campaigns with other platforms such as search, social, and video.

LocalAds tracks both offline and online behaviors to serve relevant ads. When a customer enters an identified blueprint location, the system captures the device ID of their mobile phone and tracks the consumer throughout their digital and physical customer journey.
