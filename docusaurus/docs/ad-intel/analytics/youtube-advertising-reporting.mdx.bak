YouTube advertising reporting metrics are visible in Advertising Intelligence when you have a Google Ads account connected. See how much you pay for each full view of your video and where viewers may be dropping off.

### **What is the benefit of YouTube Reporting?**

Video advertising helps you reach your target audience in an engaging and memorable way. With YouTube Ads reporting, see which videos are being watched and for how long. Determine which videos are successful or where viewers may be dropping off to create new and engaging content. With YouTube metrics now visible in Advertising Intelligence, these insights are available alongside the rest of your PPC reporting.

### **How does YouTube reporting work?**

If the customer has Advertising Intelligence alone (without the Advanced Reporting add-on), they can see their YouTube campaign in the Overview tab of the product dashboard. They can see Impressions, Clicks, CTR, Client CPC, Client Spend, Conversions, and ROI.

If the customer has the Advanced Reporting add-on, they can see more data. Within Advertising Intelligence, click into any campaign and navigate to the **YouTube** tab. Your video metrics display here if there are any to show. You must have your Google Ads account connected for this to work.

In the YouTube tab, you can view the number of views, clicks, impressions, client spend, client cost-per-view, and the video view rates at 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% for each individual video.
