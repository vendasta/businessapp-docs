Your connected digital advertising campaigns appear in the Executive Report. The Advertising Intelligence section displays Impressions, Clicks, Conversions, and Phone Calls (if applicable). Access Advertising Intelligence directly from the report to view detailed campaign information.

**Impressions** - The number of times your ads were shown to users.

**Clicks** - The number of times users clicked on your ads.

**Conversions** - The number of actions users completed after interacting with your ads, such as product purchases, newsletter sign-ups, calls to your business, or app downloads.

**Phone Calls** - The number of calls made to your call tracking number. This metric appears when you have the Call Tracking add-on purchased for the advertising campaign. For more information, see [connect call tracking](../faqs/connect-call-tracking).
