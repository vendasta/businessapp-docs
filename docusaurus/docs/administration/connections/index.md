## What Can I Manage in Connections?
The **Connections** section allows you to link third-party tools directly to your app. These integrations bring your most important business data into one place and allow services across your app to work together.

By connecting platforms like Google, Facebook, and others, you can:

- Sync location, lead, or campaign data  
- Power reporting tools like the Executive Report and Marketing Funnel  
- Enable automations and trigger workflows  
- Improve communication and scheduling with customers

Connections are shared across most activated products.

## Why Are Connections Important?
When your tools are connected, your app can use real data to show what's working. Integrations help you track marketing performance, and trigger smart actions—like sending review requests or appointment reminders.

Connecting accounts also reduces manual work by automatically syncing data between systems, improving the accuracy and efficiency of your daily operations.

## Types of Integrations

Your app supports three different methods of connecting external platforms. Each method serves a different use case depending on how the integration is built, who manages it, and how it’s authenticated. Understanding these types will help you navigate set up for the connection you are working with. 

| **Integration Type**  | **Best For**                             | **Setup Method**                |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Vendor-Managed**    | Prebuilt connections                      | Log in and connect               |
| **SSO-Based**         | Secure logins and synced data             | Single sign-on authorization     |
| **API-Key Based**     | Custom or advanced external connections   | Generate and use API credentials |

Within each specific app (after you press `Connect`) you will be prompted with special instructions on how to nagivate and set up the connection. 

## How to Manage or Disconnect Integrations
1. From the `Connections` section, select the `Manage` tab.  
2. View the list of active integrations and their connection status.  
3. Click any integration to:
   - See connected accounts  
   - Reconnect if authorization has expired  
   - Disconnect the platform  

## What Data Gets Synced
Each integration sends specific data to your app, depending on its purpose. For example:

- **Lead forms** from Facebook  
- **Website performance** from Google Analytics  
- **Search visibility** from Google Business Profile  
- **Customer and job data** from Housecall Pro or Jobber  
- **Financial records** from QuickBooks
