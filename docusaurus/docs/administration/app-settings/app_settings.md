# App Settings Overview

## What are App Settings?
Your **App Settings** allow you to configure how your account behaves behind the scenes. These settings influence workflows, integrations, data capture, and lead managementâ€”making it easier to scale your operations efficiently.

This section includes tools for automating actions, connecting third-party platforms, customizing CRM fields, and scoring leads based on behavior and fit.

## Automations

Use the **Automations** tool to set up rules that automatically trigger actions when certain events occur. 

Automations you might want to trigger:
- Send a follow-up email when a form is submitted
- Create a task when a new lead is added
- Assign contacts to a specific stage based on their actions

Each automation includes:
- **Trigger** (e.g., form submission, stage change)
- **Conditions** (optional filters)
- **Actions** (e.g., email, task, CRM update)

Automations help streamline routine tasks and improve response times without manual input.

You can also navigate directly to your automations by selecting the `Automations` tab on the Business App side bar.

## Connections

The **Connections** section allows you to link your account to external services. These integrations enable data syncing, performance tracking, and automation across platforms.

Common connections include:
- **Google Business Profile**
- **Google Ads and Analytics**
- **Meta (Facebook/Instagram)**
- **Email providers**
- **Form builders and scheduling tools**

Once connected, Business App can pull data from these sources to enhance reporting, listings, and communication tools.

## CRM Fields

In **CRM Fields**, you can define what data is collected and displayed in your contact and company records.

You can:
- Add custom fields (text, dropdown, date, etc.)
- Organize fields into sections
- Set which fields are required or optional
- Manage visibility for each field

This lets you tailor the CRM to match your sales process or customer lifecycle.

## Score

The **Score** feature allows you to assign points to leads or customers based on behaviors and attributes.

Scoring can include criteria such as:
- Location
- Phone number and email 
- Email engagement
- Last activity date

You can use scoring to:
- Prioritize leads
- Qualify contacts for follow-up
- Trigger automations based on readiness

Scoring helps your team focus on the contacts that are most likely to convert.
