**Step 4:** Select "Reviews" to configure the reviews displayed on the review widget by star rating and the rating format with one or two decimal points.

**Step 5:** The "feed layout" is the default layout for the Review Widget, for users who want to customize the layout, select "layout" and choose from either the carousel or badge with new configurations with the purchase of Review Widget Pro.

**Step 7:** Once you have configured the Review Widget, select "Save" and "Add to Website" to copy and paste the HTML code into the website's body element. If you change the sources, layout or styling after the HTML code has been installed on the website, you only have to press save to push those updates to the live widget.
