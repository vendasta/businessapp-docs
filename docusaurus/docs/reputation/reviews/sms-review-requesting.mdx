## Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary>How will I know when my SMS registration is approved?</summary>

After submitting SMS registration, the approval process typically takes one to four weeks depending on the carrier's review process. Once the registration is approved, an email notification is sent to confirm the approval (if instant email notifications are enabled in your notification settings). There is no need to check the dashboard daily—you will be notified when the registration is complete and SMS messaging is ready to use.

<details>
<summary>Why was my SMS registration rejected?</summary>

The most common reasons for rejection are website compliance issues and business information mismatches. Carriers now manually review your website for privacy policy requirements and opt-in checkboxes. See [SMS Registration for US Businesses](/business-app/administration/sms_configuration#why-registrations-are-rejected) for detailed rejection reasons and solutions.
