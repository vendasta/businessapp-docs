## Responding to Positive Reviews

For positive reviews, thank them for their praise, and invite them to come back. You can let them know about upcoming promotions that they might be interested in. You can use your business name in the response to increase your SEO. Remember, positive reviews also make great social posts! If you have Social Marketing connected to the account, click the **Share** icon to share the review on your social networks.

## Responding to Negative Reviews

Negative reviews should also be personalized to the content of the review. You want them to know that you are listening to their concerns. Make sure to apologize for the experience, and invite the reviewer to resolve the issue offline. It's always better to deal with their issues privately.

## Unable to respond to Google Review

You may encounter an error message when attempting to respond to a Google review. This is usually caused by the review being removed from Google shortly after it is pulled into Reputation AI.

## How Long Does It Take for Reviews to Appear in Reputation AI?

The platform imports reviews at different speeds depending on whether the review source is monitored or directly connected to the platform.

### Monitored Review Sources (Standard, Not Connected)

For review sites including Google and Facebook if they are not connected, the platform automatically checks for new reviews and imports them within 24 hours of when they're posted on the source website.

These are refreshed regularly but do not use a direct API connection.

### Connected Review Sources (Direct Integrations)

Google Business Profile and Facebook Pages can be securely connected to the platform through direct API integrations. When connected, these sources offer faster review syncing, allowing new reviews to appear more quickly than with monitored reviewed sources.

#### Google Business Profile (Connected Accounts)

New Google reviews typically sync two hours after they're posted, based on the timing at which Google provides new review data.

#### Facebook Pages (Connected Accounts)

New Facebook reviews and recommendations typically sync about 10 minutes after they're posted, following Facebook's standard timing for releasing new review information.

### My Listing (Vendasta Listing Source)

Reviews submitted through My Listing appear immediately in Vendasta, since they originate and are managed directly within the platform.
