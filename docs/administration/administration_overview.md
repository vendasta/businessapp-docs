## What is the Administration section?
The **Administration** section in Business App provides access to system-wide configuration tools all in one place.

- Your tools are connected and synced correctly
- AI and messaging features are properly configured
- Workflows and communication channels are set-up in a way that steamlines your operations specific to your needs

This section is organized by purpose and functionality, allowing you to set up the foundation for how Business App works across your organization.

Keeping these foundational settings aligned improves daily operations and makes your system easier to manage over time.
