# Inbox

## Overview

Inbox is a communication tool that centralizes customer messages from email, Facebook, Instagram, and AI-powered web chat into one dashboard. It enables teams to view and respond to conversations collaboratively, without needing to switch between platforms. 

If enabled, AI-powered web chat responds to and captures leads instantly, helping you stay responsive 24/7. Inbox unites all conversations—including those from your connected Google Business Profile and SMS messages — into one shared view. Inbox reduces the need to manage multiple apps or disconnected systems.

## Why is this feature important?

Small businesses often lose time and opportunities by managing messages across disconnected platforms. Without visibility into all conversations, responses are delayed and teams may duplicate efforts. Inbox consolidates these conversations into a shared workspace, helping businesses stay organized, improve response times, and create a more consistent customer experience.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

**Can Inbox integrate with other CRMs or messaging systems?**  
Yes. Businesses can centralize their contact data using available integrations with Zapier, QuickBooks, and more. Automations can also be created to trigger messaging events.

**What automations are available for Inbox?**  
Automations include triggers such as `Message Received` and actions like `Send Email` or `Send SMS.` These allow users to build custom workflows and responses.

**Is there a per-use cost for the AI web chat?**  
No. Unlimited AI responses are included with Inbox Pro. There are no per-message or per-interaction fees.

**What languages does the AI assistant support?**  
The assistant can respond in over 40 languages, including English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Turkish, Polish, Ukrainian, Russian, Japanese, and Chinese.

**If we install the Inbox Pro chat on our website, will it be only AI answering customers or will real agents talk to customers?**  
The web chat is 100% AI-managed lead capture. Small businesses are busy, and can't always reply instantly – that's why the AI is pre-programmed to capture website visitor's name and number, and then notify the business they have a new lead. The AI will continue the conversation until you can reply via SMS, and move the conversation off the website and onto the customer's phone.

**How much does the chatbot know about the business? Can it answer questions?**  
The AI can access "knowledge" from the business profile, so it can answer questions about services, location and contact info, and hours. It can also be trained on your website. You can also add additional text Q&A 'knowledge' to the AI knowledge so it can answer frequently asked questions from any text.
