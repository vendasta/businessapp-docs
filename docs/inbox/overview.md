**What inbox features are included in Business App?**

Every Business App account comes with these messaging integrations in Inbox:

**Email** – Inbox allows your team to send and receive emails with leads and customers via Inbox from a shared email address. When your business gets a new lead from web chat or a form, and that lead provides an email address as a way to contact them, anyone on your team can reply via email to that customer from your centralized Inbox, without needing to open a separate email client.

**Facebook Pages** – Connect to a Facebook page to communicate with customers on Facebook. Available worldwide.

**Instagram (ETA Summer 2024)** – Connect to an Instagram Business account to message with customers through Instagram. Available worldwide.

**Website Form lead capture** – Install a form on the businesses website to capture the contact details of a lead, and respond using SMS or email.

**Multi-Location Inbox** – For users with access to Multi-location Business App, conversations can be managed across many locations using Inbox in Multi-Location.

**Team shared Inbox** – Everyone at the business can view and participate in customer conversations, collaborating on delivering a good customer experience, so they're not tied up with just one person, on their personal phones.

**Inbox Pro Upgrade – What's included?**

The following features are enabled by activating Inbox Pro for an account.

**How to install your web chat widget**

**How to setup email forwarding (optional)**

By default, you can send and receive emails from Inbox using an assigned Inbox email address.  If you choose, you can also receive all emails sent to any email address you own inside Inbox also, by setting up forwarding. For example, maybe you’ve published a public email address, or you’re using other tools to capture new leads at your owned email address, team@yourcompany.com. By setting up forwarding, any email sent to that address can appear inside of Inbox as well, so all leads are centralized in your CRM, and your whole team can manage these messages.

**Q: How do I send a message to someone using Facebook or Instagram?**

**Q: If we install the Inbox Pro chat on our website, will it be only AI agent answering customers or will real agents talk to customers?**

A: The web chat is 100% AI-managed lead capture. Small businesses are busy, and can't always reply instantly – that's why the AI assistant will get a website visitor's name and number, and then notify the business they have a new lead – the business can reply via SMS as soon as possible, and move the conversation off the website and onto the customer's phone.

**Q: How much does the chatbot know about the business? Can it answer questions?**

A: The AI assistant can access "knowledge" from the business profile, so it can answer questions about services, location and contact info, and hours. You can also add additional text Q&A 'knowledge' to the AI assistant so it can answer frequently asked questions from any supplied text.

**Q: How do I install the web chat widget?**

A: The web chat widget can be installed on any website. To install, copy and paste the widget install code into the <head> element of your website, typically just before the closing </head> tag.
