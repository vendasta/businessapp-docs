# Gray-Label Documentation for Business Owners

This documentation is written for **business owners** (end users), not partners, agencies, or resellers.

## Audience Guidelines

- Write as if speaking directly to a small business owner using the platform
- Use "you" and "your business" - never reference third parties managing their account
- Focus on benefits and outcomes, not technical implementation details
- Assume the reader wants to accomplish a task, not understand the platform architecture

## Gray-Label / Branding Rules

**NEVER mention:**
- "Vendasta" (the parent company)
- Any partner/reseller/agency terminology
- Platform internals or white-label concepts

**Instead, use:**
- "Business App" or the specific product name (WordPress Hosting, Local SEO, etc.)
- Generic terms like "your provider" only if absolutely necessary
- Product-focused language: "WordPress Hosting includes..." not "Vendasta's WordPress Hosting..."

## Examples

| Avoid | Use Instead |
|-------|-------------|
| "Vendasta's WordPress Hosting product" | "WordPress Hosting" |
| "Vendasta has made it easier..." | "You can now easily..." |
| "one of Vendasta's templates" | "one of the pre-built templates" |
| "your partner provides..." | "this feature allows you to..." |
