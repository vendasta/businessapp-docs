# Business App Article Standards

## Evergreen Content Principle

Write only about the current, live state of the product.

**Never include references to:**
- Previously, Formerly, Used to
- Before this update, Earlier versions
- Legacy, Deprecated, Renamed
- Has since changed
- Historical comparisons of any kind

**Rule**: If a detail cannot be written without referencing the past, omit it.

## Voice and Style

- **Tone**: Calm, clear, neutral
- **Tense**: Present tense only
- **Audience**: Small to medium-sized business users
- **Perspective**: Second person ('you')

**Prohibited language:**
- Marketing or promotional language
- Speculation or future-state phrasing
- Hypothetical personas or scenarios
- References to internal teams or partners

## Content Policy

- **Source-based only**: Use only information explicitly provided in source material
- **No assumptions**: Do not infer functionality, UI, or workflows
- **Live features only**: Document only currently available features

## Frontmatter Requirements

All documentation files must include YAML frontmatter at the top of the file.

**Required fields:**
- `title` - The page title (string)

**Recommended fields:**
- `sidebar_label` - Short label for sidebar navigation
- `description` - Brief description for SEO
- `tags` - Array of relevant tags
- `keywords` - Array of keywords for search

**Format rules:**
- Each YAML key must be on its own line
- Do not place multiple keys on one line
- No text before the opening `---`
- No text between opening `---` and first field
- No text after closing `---` before content begins

**Example:**
```markdown
---
title: Connect Your Facebook Account
sidebar_label: Connect Facebook
description: Learn how to connect your Facebook account to manage posts and ads
tags: [social-marketing, setup]
keywords: [facebook, social media, connect account]
---
```

## Heading Structure

- **H2 (`##`)**: Main sections only
- **H3 (`###`)**: Subsections only
- Use plain, descriptive titles
- No promotional or marketing language in headings

## Formatting Conventions

### Lists and Steps
- **Bullet points**: For lists of items, features, or options
- **Numbered lists**: For sequential steps or instructions only

### Inline Code
Use inline code (backticks) for:
- UI labels: Click the `Save` button
- Button names: Select `Connect Account`
- Tab names: Go to the `Settings` tab
- Field names: Enter your email in the `Email Address` field
- Menu items: Navigate to `Tools` > `Integrations`

### Callout Blocks

**Info blocks** - Optional tips or helpful context:
```markdown
:::info
This feature is available on all plans.
:::
```

**Warning blocks** - Limitations or requirements:
```markdown
:::warning
You must be an account administrator to access this feature.
:::
```

## Images

**Storage location**: All images must be stored in an `img` folder inside the feature folder.

**Path format**: `./img/{image-name}.png`

**Naming convention**:
- Use kebab-case only (lowercase with hyphens)
- Descriptive names: `connect-facebook-button.png` not `image1.png`

**Requirements**:
- Alt text is required for all images
- No subfolders within the `img` directory
- Supported formats: PNG, JPG, GIF

**Example:**
```markdown
![Click the Connect button to link your account](./img/connect-button.png)
```

## Links

### Internal Links
- **Format**: Use relative paths only
- **Example**: `[Connect account](../accounts/connect-profile.md)`
- Use file extensions (`.md` or `.mdx`)
- Paths are relative to current file location

### External Links
- **Format**: Use full URLs starting with `https://`
- **Example**: `[Google setup guide](https://support.google.com/business/answer/2911778)`
- Prefer HTTPS over HTTP
- Open in same window (default behavior)

## FAQs

When including FAQs in articles:

**Count**: Include 3–10 short FAQs per article

**Format**: Use HTML details/summary tags for collapsible sections
```markdown
<details>
<summary>How do I reset my password?</summary>

Click the "Forgot Password" link on the login page and follow the instructions sent to your email.
</details>
```

**Focus areas:**
- Common setup issues
- Terminology explanations
- Feature limitations
- Error resolution
- General usage guidance

**FAQ Guidelines:**
- Keep answers concise (1-3 sentences ideal)
- Use the same voice and style as main content
- No speculation or "it depends" answers
- Link to related articles when relevant
